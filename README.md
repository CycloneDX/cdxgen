# CycloneDX Generator

![cdxgen logo](cdxgen.png)

cdxgen is a CLI tool, library, [REPL](./ADVANCED.md), and server to create a valid and compliant [CycloneDX][cyclonedx-homepage] Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) containing an aggregate of all project dependencies for C/C++, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Java, .Net, Dart, Haskell, Elixir, and Go projects in JSON format. CycloneDX 1.5 is a lightweight SBOM specification that is easily created, human and machine-readable, and simple to parse.

When used with plugins, cdxgen could generate an OBOM for Linux docker images and even VMs running Linux or Windows operating systems. cdxgen also includes an evinse tool to generate component evidence and SaaSBOM for some languages.

NOTE:

CycloneDX 1.5 specification is new and unsupported by many downstream tools. Use version 8.6.0 for 1.4 compatibility or pass the argument `--spec-version 1.4`.

## Why cdxgen?

Most SBOM tools are like barcode scanners. They can scan a few package manifest and create a list of components only based on these files without any deep inspection. Further, a typical application might have several repos, components, and libraries. Traditional techniques to generate a SBOM per language or package manifest either do not work in enterprise environments or doesn't provide the confidence required for both compliance and automated analysis. So we built cdxgen - the universal polyglot SBOM generator that is both precise and comprehensive!

NOTE:

- Apache maven 3.x is required for parsing pom.xml
- gradle or gradlew is required to parse gradle projects
- sbt is required for parsing scala sbt projects. Only scala 2.10 + sbt 0.13.6+ and 2.12 + sbt 1.0+ are currently supported.
  - Alternatively, create a lock file using sbt-dependency-lock [plugin](https://github.com/stringbean/sbt-dependency-lock)

Footnotes:

- [1] - For multi-module applications, the BOM file could include components not included in the packaged war or ear file.
- [2] - Pip freeze is automatically performed to improve precision. Requires virtual environment.
- [3] - Perform dotnet or nuget restore to generate project.assets.json. Without this file, cdxgen would not include indirect dependencies.
- [4] - See the section on plugins
- [5] - Powered by osquery. See the section on plugins

### Automatic usage detection

For node.js projects, lock files are parsed initially, so the SBOM would include all dependencies, including dev ones. An AST parser powered by babel-parser is then used to detect packages that are imported and used by non-test code. Such imported packages would automatically set their scope property to `required` in the resulting SBOM. You can turn off this analysis by passing the argument `--no-babel`. Scope property would then be set based on the `dev` attribute in the lock file.

This attribute can be later used for various purposes. For example, [dep-scan](https://github.com/cyclonedx/dep-scan) uses this attribute to prioritize vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, tools such as dependency track, do not include this feature and might over-report the CVEs.

By passing the argument `--required-only`, you can limit the SBOM only to include packages with the scope "required", commonly called production or non-dev dependencies. Combine with `--no-babel` to limit this list to only non-dev dependencies based on the `dev` attribute being false in the lock files.

For go, `go mod why` command is used to identify required packages. For php, composer lock file is parsed to distinguish required (packages) from optional (packages-dev).

## Usage

## Installing

```shell
sudo npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen

# For CycloneDX 1.4 compatibility use version 8.6.0 or pass the argument `--spec-version 1.4`
sudo npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen@8.6.0
```

If you are a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) user, you can also install [cdxgen](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cdxgen) via:

```shell
$ brew install cdxgen
```

Deno install is also supported.

```shell
deno install --allow-read --allow-env --allow-run --allow-sys=uid,systemMemoryInfo,gid --allow-write --allow-net -n cdxgen "npm:@cyclonedx/cdxgen/cdxgen"
```

You can also use the cdxgen container image

```bash
docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app:rw -t ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen -r /app -o /app/bom.json

docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app:rw -t ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen:v8.6.0 -r /app -o /app/bom.json
```

To use the deno version, use `ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen-deno` as the image name.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app:rw -t ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen-deno -r /app -o /app/bom.json
```

In deno applications, cdxgen could be directly imported without any conversion. Please see the section on [integration as library](#integration-as-library)

```ts
import { createBom, submitBom } from "npm:@cyclonedx/cdxgen@^9.0.1";
```

```

All boolean arguments accept `--no` prefix to toggle the behavior.

## Example

Minimal example.

```shell
cdxgen -o bom.json
```

For a java project. cdxgen would automatically detect maven, gradle, or sbt and build bom accordingly

```shell
cdxgen -t java -o bom.json
```

To print the SBOM as a table pass `-p` argument.

```shell
cdxgen -t java -o bom.json -p
```

To recursively generate a single BOM for all languages pass `-r` argument.

```shell
cdxgen -r -o bom.json
```

To generate SBOM for an older specification version, such as 1.4, pass the version number using the `--spec-version` argument.

```shell
cdxgen -r -o bom.json --spec-version 1.4
```

To generate SBOM for C or Python, ensure Java >= 17 is installed.

```shell
# Install java >= 17
cdxgen -t c -o bom.json
```

NOTE: cdxgen is known to freeze with Java 8 or 11, so ensure >= 17 is installed and JAVA_HOME environment variable is configured correctly. If in doubt, use the cdxgen container image.

## Universal SBOM

By passing the type argument `-t universal`, cdxgen could be forced to opportunistically collect as many components and services as possible by scanning all package, container, and Kubernetes manifests. The resulting SBOM could have over a thousand components, thus requiring additional triaging before use with traditional SCA tools.

## SBOM server

Invoke cdxgen with `--server` argument to run it in server mode. By default, it listens to port `9090`, which can be customized with the arguments `--server-host` and `--server-port`.

```shell
cdxgen --server
```

Or use the container image.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -p 9090:9090 -v $(pwd):/app:rw -t ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen -r /app --server --server-host 0.0.0.0
```

Use curl or your favorite tool to pass arguments to the `/sbom` route.

### Server arguments

Arguments can be passed either via the query string or as a JSON body. The following arguments are supported.

| Argument       | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type           | Project type                                                                                                                                |

| noBabel        | Do not use babel to perform usage analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript projects. [boolean]                                                    |
| installDeps    | Install dependencies automatically for some projects. Defaults to true but disabled for containers and oci scans. [boolean] [default: true] |
| project        |                                                                                                                                             |
| projectName    | Dependency track project name. Default use the directory name                                                                               |
| projectGroup   | Dependency track project group                                                                                                              |

### Health endpoint

Use the /health endpoint to check if the SBOM server is up and running.

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9090/health"
```

### Scanning a local path

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9090/sbom?path=/Volumes/Work/sandbox/vulnerable-aws-koa-app&multiProject=true&type=js"
```

### Scanning a git repo

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9090/sbom?url=https://github.com/HooliCorp/vulnerable-aws-koa-app.git&multiProject=true&type=js"
```

You can POST the arguments.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9090/sbom -XPOST -d $'{"url": "https://github.com/HooliCorp/vulnerable-aws-koa-app.git", "type": "nodejs", "multiProject": "true"}'
```

### Docker compose

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cyclonedx/cdxgen.git
docker compose up
```

## War file support

cdxgen can generate a BOM file from a given war file.

```shell
# cdxgen -t java app.war
cdxgen app.war
```

## Resolving class names

Sometimes, it is necessary to resolve class names contained in jar files. By passing an optional argument `--resolve-class`, it is possible to get cdxgen to create a separate mapping file with the jar name (including the version) as the key and class names list as a value.

```shell
cdxgen -t java --resolve-class -o bom.json
```

This would create a bom.json.map file with the jar - class name mapping. Refer to [these](test/data/bom-maven.json.map) [examples](test/data/bom-gradle.json.map) to learn about the structure.

## Resolving licenses

cdxgen can automatically query public registries such as maven, npm, or nuget to resolve the package licenses. This is a time-consuming operation and is disabled by default. To enable, set the environment variable `FETCH_LICENSE` to `true`, as shown.

```bash
export FETCH_LICENSE=true
```

## Dependency Tree

cdxgen can retain the dependency tree under the `dependencies` attribute for a small number of supported package manifests. These are currently limited to:

- package-lock.json
- yarn.lock
- pnpm-lock.yaml
- Maven (pom.xml)
- Gradle
- Scala SBT
- Python (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, poetry.lock)
- .NET (project.assets.json, paket.lock)
- Go (go.mod)

## Plugins

cdxgen could be extended with external binary plugins to support more SBOM use cases. These are now installed as an optional dependency.

```shell
sudo npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen-plugins-bin
```

### Docker / OCI container support

`docker` type is automatically detected based on the presence of values such as `sha256` or `docker.io` prefix etc in the path.

```shell
cdxgen odoo@sha256:4e1e147f0e6714e8f8c5806d2b484075b4076ca50490577cdf9162566086d15e -o /tmp/bom.json
```

You can also pass `-t docker` for basic labels. Only the `latest` tag would be pulled if none was specified.

```shell
cdxgen shiftleft/scan-slim -o /tmp/bom.json -t docker
```

You can also pass the .tar file of a container image.

```shell
docker pull shiftleft/scan-slim
docker save -o /tmp/slim.tar shiftleft/scan-slim
podman save -q --format oci-archive -o /tmp/slim.tar shiftleft/scan-slim
cdxgen /tmp/slim.tar -o /tmp/bom.json -t docker
```

### Podman in rootless mode

Setup podman in either [rootless](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md) or [remote](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/docs/tutorials/mac_win_client.md) mode

Do not forget to start the podman socket required for API access on Linux.

```shell
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
systemctl --user start podman.socket
podman system service -t 0 &
```

### Generate OBOM for a live system

You can use the `obom` command to generate an OBOM for a live system or a VM for compliance and vulnerability management purposes. Windows and Linux operating systems are supported in this mode.

```shell
# obom is an alias for cdxgen -t os
obom
# cdxgen -t os
```

This feature is powered by osquery, which is [installed](https://github.com/cyclonedx/cdxgen-plugins-bin/blob/main/build.sh#L8) along with the binary plugins. cdxgen would opportunistically try to detect as many components, apps, and extensions as possible using the [default queries](queries.json). The process would take several minutes and result in an SBOM file with thousands of components of various types, such as operating-system, device-drivers, files, and data.

## Generating SaaSBOM and component evidences

See [evinse mode](./ADVANCED.md) in the advanced documentation.

## BoM signing

cdxgen can sign the generated BOM json file to increase authenticity and non-repudiation capabilities. To enable this, set the following environment variables.

- SBOM_SIGN_ALGORITHM: Algorithm. Example: RS512
- SBOM_SIGN_PRIVATE_KEY: Location to the RSA private key
- SBOM_SIGN_PUBLIC_KEY: Optional. Location to the RSA public key

To generate test public/private key pairs, you can run cdxgen by passing the argument `--generate-key-and-sign`. The generated json file would have an attribute called `signature`, which could be used for validation. [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) is a known site that could be used for such signature validation.

### Verifying the signature

Use the bundled `cdx-verify` command, which supports verifying a single signature added at the bom level.

```shell
npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen
cdx-verify -i bom.json --public-key public.key
```

### Custom verification tool (Node.js example)

There are many [libraries](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) available to validate JSON Web Tokens. Below is a javascript example.

```js
# npm install jws
const jws = require("jws");
const fs = require("fs");
// Location of the SBOM json file
const bomJsonFile = "bom.json";
// Location of the public key
const publicKeyFile = "public.key";
const bomJson = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(bomJsonFile, "utf8"));
// Retrieve the signature
const bomSignature = bomJson.signature.value;
const validationResult = jws.verify(bomSignature, bomJson.signature.algorithm, fs.readFileSync(publicKeyFile, "utf8"));
if (validationResult) {
  console.log("Signature is valid!");
} else {
  console.log("SBOM signature is invalid :(");
}
```

## Automatic services detection

cdxgen can automatically detect names of services from YAML manifests such as docker-compose, Kubernetes, or Skaffold manifests. These would be populated under the `services` attribute in the generated SBOM. With [evinse](./ADVANCED.md), additional services could be detected by parsing common annotations from the source code.

## Integration as library

cdxgen is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) and could be imported and used with both deno and Node.js >= 16

Minimal example:

```ts
import { createBom, submitBom } from "npm:@cyclonedx/cdxgen@^9.0.1";
```

See the [Deno Readme](./contrib/deno/README.md) for detailed instructions.

```javascript
import { createBom, submitBom } from "@cyclonedx/cdxgen";
// bomNSData would contain bomJson, bomXml
const bomNSData = await createBom(filePath, options);
// Submission to dependency track server
const dbody = await submitBom(args, bomNSData.bomJson);
```

## Node.js >= 20 permission model

Refer to the [permissions document](./docs/PERMISSIONS.md)
