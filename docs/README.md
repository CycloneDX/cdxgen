# Getting Started <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

cdxgen is available as an npm package, container image, and single application executables. Begin your journey by selecting your use case.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Generate SBOM for git repos**

## Installation

```shell
sudo npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen
```

If you are a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) user, you can also install [cdxgen](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cdxgen) via:

```bash
brew install cdxgen
```

For Windows, Single Application Executable (sae) builds are available from GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen/releases) in two flavours:

- cdxgen.exe - Node 22 runtime + CLI with the optional binary plugins (atom, dosai, etc)
- cdxgen-slim.exe - Node 22 runtime + CLI

## Usage

Minimal example.

```shell
cd <Path to source code>
cdxgen -o bom.json
```

For a java project. This would automatically detect maven, gradle or sbt and build bom accordingly

```shell
cdxgen -t java -o bom.json
```

To print the SBOM as a table pass `-p` argument.

```shell
cdxgen -t java -o bom.json -p
```

To recursively generate a single BOM for all languages pass `-r` argument.

```shell
cdxgen -r -o bom.json
```

To generate SBOM for an older specification version such as 1.4, pass the version using the `--spec-version` argument.

```shell
cdxgen -r -o bom.json --spec-version 1.4
```

To generate SBOM for C or Python, ensure Java >= 21 is installed.

```shell
# Install java >= 21
cdxgen -t c -o bom.json
```

#### **Generate SBOM for container images**

## Installation

```shell
sudo npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen
```

## Usage

`docker` type is automatically detected based on the presence of values such as `sha256` or `docker.io` prefix etc in the path.

```shell
cdxgen odoo@sha256:4e1e147f0e6714e8f8c5806d2b484075b4076ca50490577cdf9162566086d15e -o bom.json
```

You can also pass `-t docker` for simple labels. Only the `latest` tag would be pulled if none was specified.

```shell
cdxgen ghcr.io/owasp-dep-scan/depscan:nightly -o bom.json -t docker
```

You can also pass the .tar file of a container image.

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/owasp-dep-scan/depscan
docker save -o /tmp/slim.tar ghcr.io/owasp-dep-scan/depscan
podman save -q --format oci-archive -o /tmp/slim.tar ghcr.io/owasp-dep-scan/depscan
cdxgen /tmp/slim.tar -o /tmp/bom.json -t docker
```

### Podman in rootless mode

Setup podman in either [rootless](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md) or [remote](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/docs/tutorials/mac_win_client.md) mode

On Linux, do not forget to start the podman socket which is required for API access.

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
systemctl --user start podman.socket
podman system service -t 0 &
```

#### **Generate OBOM**

You can use the `obom` command to generate an OBOM for a live system or a VM for compliance and vulnerability management purposes. Windows and Linux operating systems are supported in this mode.

```shell
# obom is an alias for cdxgen -t os
obom
# cdxgen -t os
```

This feature is powered by osquery, which is [installed](https://github.com/cyclonedx/cdxgen-plugins-bin/blob/main/build.sh#L8) along with the binary plugins. cdxgen would opportunistically try to detect as many components, apps, and extensions as possible using the [default queries](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen/blob/master/data/queries.json). The process would take several minutes and result in an SBOM file with thousands of components of various types such as operating-system, device-drivers, files, and data.

#### **Integrate with Dependency Track**

Invoke cdxgen with the below arguments to automatically submit the BOM to your organization's Dependency Track server.

```shell
      --type                   Project type. Please refer to https://cyclonedx.g
                               ithub.io/cdxgen/#/PROJECT_TYPES for supported lan
                               guages/platforms.
      --server-url             Dependency track url. Eg: https://deptrack.cyclon
                               edx.io
      --api-key                Dependency track api key
      --project-group          Dependency track project group
      --project-name           Dependency track project name. Default use the di
                               rectory name
      --project-version        Dependency track project version    [default: ""]
      --project-id             Dependency track project id. Either provide the i
                               d or the project name and version together
      --parent-project-id      Dependency track parent project id
```

## Example

```shell
cdxgen -t java -o bom.json --server-url https://deptrack.server.com --api-key "token" --project-group ...
```

# Supported Languages and Package Managers

See our [Supported Project Types](https://cyclonedx.github.io/cdxgen/#/PROJECT_TYPES) documentation

# Advanced Usage

cdxgen supports advanced use cases as a library and in REPL mode.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Resolving Licenses**

cdxgen can automatically query public registries such as maven, npm, or nuget to resolve the package licenses. This is a time-consuming operation and is disabled by default. To enable, set the environment variable `FETCH_LICENSE` to `true`, as shown.

```bash
export FETCH_LICENSE=true
```

#### **SBOM Server**

Invoke cdxgen with `--server` argument to run it in server mode. By default, it listens to port `9090`, which can be customized with the arguments `--server-host` and `--server-port`.

```shell
cdxgen --server
```

Or use the container image.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -p 9090:9090 -v $(pwd):/app:rw -t ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen -r /app --server --server-host 0.0.0.0
```

Use curl or your favourite tool to pass arguments to the `/sbom` route.

### Scanning a local path

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9090/sbom?path=/Volumes/Work/sandbox/vulnerable-aws-koa-app&multiProject=true&type=js"
```

### Scanning a git repo

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9090/sbom?url=https://github.com/HooliCorp/vulnerable-aws-koa-app.git&multiProject=true&type=js"
```

If you need to pass credentials to authenticate.

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9090/sbom?url=https://<access_token>@github.com/some/repo.git&multiProject=true&type=js"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9090/sbom?url=https://<username>:<password>@bitbucket.org/some/repo.git&multiProject=true&type=js"
```

You can POST the arguments.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9090/sbom -XPOST -d $'{"url": "https://github.com/HooliCorp/vulnerable-aws-koa-app.git", "type": "nodejs", "multiProject": "true"}'
```

#### **Integration as Library**

cdxgen is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) and could be imported and used with both deno and Node.js >= 20

Minimal example:

```ts
import { createBom, submitBom } from "npm:@cyclonedx/cdxgen@^9.9.0";
```

See the [Deno Readme](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen/blob/master/contrib/deno/README.md) for detailed instructions.

```javascript
import { createBom, submitBom } from "@cyclonedx/cdxgen";
// bomNSData would contain bomJson
const bomNSData = await createBom(filePath, options);
// Submission to dependency track server
const dbody = await submitBom(args, bomNSData.bomJson);
```

#### **BOM Signing**

cdxgen can sign the generated BOM json file to increase authenticity and non-repudiation capabilities. To enable this, set the following environment variables.

- SBOM_SIGN_ALGORITHM: Algorithm. Example: RS512
- SBOM_SIGN_PRIVATE_KEY: Location to the RSA private key
- SBOM_SIGN_PUBLIC_KEY: Optional. Location to the RSA public key

To generate test public/private key pairs, you can run cdxgen by passing the argument `--generate-key-and-sign`. The generated json file would have an attribute called `signature`, which could be used for validation. [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) is a known site that could be used for such signature validation.

### Verifying the signature

Use the bundled `cdx-verify` command, which supports verifying a single signature added at the bom level.

```shell
npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen
cdx-verify -i bom.json --public-key public.key
```

### Custom verification tool (Node.js example)

There are many [libraries](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) available to validate JSON Web Tokens. Below is a javascript example.

```js
# npm install jws
const jws = require("jws");
const fs = require("fs");
// Location of the SBOM json file
const bomJsonFile = "bom.json";
// Location of the public key
const publicKeyFile = "public.key";
const bomJson = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(bomJsonFile, "utf8"));
// Retrieve the signature
const bomSignature = bomJson.signature.value;
const validationResult = jws.verify(bomSignature, bomJson.signature.algorithm, fs.readFileSync(publicKeyFile, "utf8"));
if (validationResult) {
  console.log("Signature is valid!");
} else {
  console.log("SBOM signature is invalid :(");
}
```

#### **REPL Mode**

`cdxi` is a new interactive REPL server to create, import, and search a BOM. All the exported functions from cdxgen and node.js could be used in this mode. In addition, several custom commands are defined.

[![cdxi demo](https://asciinema.org/a/602361.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/602361)

In addition, all the keys from [queries.json](./data/queries.json) are also valid commands. Example: `processes`, `apt_sources`, etc. Type `.help` to view the full list of commands.

### Sample REPL usage

Start the REPL server.

```shell
cdxi
```

Below are some example commands to create an SBOM for a spring application and perform searches and queries.

```
.create /mnt/work/vuln-spring
.print
.search spring
.query components[name ~> /spring/ and scope = "required"]
// Supplier names
.query $distinct(components.supplier.name)

# Check obom metadata for windows os
.query metadata.component[purl ~> /Windows/]

# check if docker is installed in the c drive
.query components[name ~> /Docker/ and properties.value ~> "C:"]

# check if docker is running, exposing a pipe
.query components[name ~> /docker/ and properties[value = "pipes_snapshot"]]

.sort name
.sort components^(>name)
.update | components[name ~> /spring/] | {'publisher': "foo"} |
```

### REPL History

Repl history will persist under the `$HOME/.config/.cdxgen` directory. To override this location, use the environment variable `CDXGEN_REPL_HISTORY`.
