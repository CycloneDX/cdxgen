| GRADLE_ARGS                                 | Set to pass additional arguments such as profile or settings to gradle (all tasks). Eg: `--init-script <your-script>.gradle`                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| GRADLE_DEPENDENCY_TASK                      | By default cdxgen use the task "dependencies" to collect packages. Set to override the task name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| GRADLE_INCLUDED_BUILDS                      | Comma-separated list of 'includedBuilds' modules that should be scanned on top of all the modules of your projects. Since includedBuilds can't be found automatically, they have to be listed here. Use gradle-conventions (include the ':'-prefix) for the names.                                                                  |
| GRADLE_RESOLVE_FROM_NODE                    | If some of your gradle modules are included from node (eg when using expo or react-native), set this to true to use the npm-packages as your dependencies. The big advantage of this, is that the generated purls will be of actually known components (eg in OSS Index) instead of generic names for the packages.                 |
| GRADLE_SKIP_MODULE_DEPENDENCIES             | Comma-separated list of modules to skip during the "dependencies" task. This can be useful if you have modules that would fail the gradle build, eg when they do not have dependencies in the given configuration. Use "root" if the top most module should be skipped, use their gradle-name (so WITH leading ":") for all others. |
| GRADLE_SKIP_MODULES                         | Comma-separated list of modules to skip for both "properties" and "dependencies" task. Use the gradle-name (so WITH leading ":"). NOTICE: when using this, neither the configured ID (group, name & version) nor the dependencies of these modules will be available!                                                               |
| GRADLE_USER_HOME                            | Specifies the directory for the Gradle user home, which typically contains cache files, build dependencies, and other configuration files used by Gradle.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| SBT_CACHE_DIR                               | Specify sbt cache directory.
