Since a different version of D (D@1) is already installed at the top level to satisfy B's dependency, npm must install D@2 as a nested dependency **inside C/node_modules/D@2**. This nesting resolves the version conflict, ensuring that both B and C get their required versions of D.\n4. **Shared C:** Even though both A and B depend on C, C is installed only once at the top level and shared between A and B because there's no version conflict for C itself.\n\nThis example illustrates how npm's algorithm handles dependency conflicts by nesting dependencies when necessary to satisfy version requirements, while still attempting to flatten the tree as much as possible."}]}
