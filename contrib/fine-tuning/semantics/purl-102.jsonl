{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the canonical form of a purl and why is it important?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The canonical form of a purl is its normalized representation, ensuring consistency and uniformity. It's important because:\n- It provides a single, standard representation for each purl, regardless of minor variations in input.\n- It simplifies comparison and deduplication of purls.\n- It ensures that different purl implementations produce the same output for the same package.\nThe 'canonical' field in the test suite provides the expected canonical form for each test purl, aiding in validation and normalization implementation."}]}

Overuse of qualifiers can make purls lengthy and less readable. It is recommended to use additional, separate external attributes (outside of the purl itself) to convey extra, lengthy, or optional information such as download URLs, VCS URLs, or checksums, especially in APIs, databases, or web forms. Qualifiers should be reserved for essential differentiating characteristics."}]}
