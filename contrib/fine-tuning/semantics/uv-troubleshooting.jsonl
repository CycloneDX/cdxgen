If the build fails with pip as well, it indicates a more general problem not specific to uv, likely related to system dependencies or the package itself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does uv attempt to build packages during resolution and installation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "uv attempts to build packages in two main scenarios:\n\n1.  **Cross-platform lockfile generation:** When generating a cross-platform lockfile, uv needs to determine dependencies for all packages, even those not for the current platform. To do this without wheels, it may attempt to build packages to extract metadata.\n2.  **Installation without wheels:** When installing packages for the current platform, uv prefers wheels. If a wheel for the current platform and Python version is not available in the package index, uv will attempt to build the package from source distribution (sdist). This ensures that packages can be installed even when pre-built binaries are not available."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I check if wheels exist for a specific Python package version on PyPI?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can check if wheels exist for a specific Python package version on PyPI by visiting the package's PyPI page and looking for the \"Download files\" section. For example, for `numpy`, visit `https://pypi.org/project/numpy/2.1.1.md#files`. In the \"Download files\" section, you can see a list of available distributions, including wheels. Wheels compatible across platforms often have filenames ending in `...-py3-none-any.whl`, while platform-specific wheels include OS and platform identifiers in their filenames."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should I do if a build failure in uv indicates a \"command is not found\" error, like missing 'gcc'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a build failure in uv indicates a \"command is not found\" error, such as a missing `gcc` command, it means your system is lacking a necessary build tool. To resolve this, you need to install the missing command using your system's package manager. For example, if `gcc` is missing, you can install it on Debian/Ubuntu using `apt install gcc`. For uv-managed Python versions, consider using `clang` instead of `gcc`, and for general build dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu, installing `build-essential` package can resolve many common build requirements."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I resolve a build failure in uv that mentions a missing header file or library, like a '.h' file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a build failure in uv points to a missing header file or library (e.g., a `.h` file), it signifies that a development dependency is not installed on your system. You need to identify the package that provides the missing header or library and install it using your system's package manager. For example, if `graphviz/cgraph.h` is missing for `pygraphviz`, you would install the development package for Graphviz, such as `libgraphviz-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu (`apt install libgraphviz-dev`). Remember to install the development version of the package, as it includes header files needed for building software."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When encountering a build failure in uv due to a \"ModuleNotFoundError\" or import error, what troubleshooting step should I consider?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you encounter a build failure in uv with a `ModuleNotFoundError` or import error, especially if it mentions a missing module like `pip`, you should consider **disabling build isolation** for the problematic package. This is because some packages incorrectly assume that certain build tools (like `pip` itself) are available in the build environment without explicitly declaring them as build dependencies. To resolve this, first pre-install the missing build dependencies (e.g., `uv pip install pip setuptools`), and then re-attempt the installation of the failing package with the `--no-build-isolation-package <package_name>` flag (e.g., `uv pip install chumpy --no-build-isolation-package chumpy`). You may need to identify and pre-install all missing build dependencies for the package to build successfully with build isolation disabled."}]}

This is because, in some cases, uv's resolver might explore very old package versions, which could lead to build issues. By setting a lower bound constraint (e.g., `numpy>=1.17` or `apache-beam<=2.49.0,>2.30.0`), you guide uv to consider more recent versions that are less likely to have build problems. You can define these constraints directly in your `requirements.txt` or using constraint files (`constraints.txt`) or the `constraint-dependencies` setting, especially for indirect dependencies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "If a uv build failure occurs because a package is only needed for an unused platform, how can I avoid this issue?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a uv build failure arises from attempting to build a package that is actually only intended for a platform you do not need to support, you should consider **limiting resolution to your supported platforms**. By configuring uv to only resolve and consider packages relevant to your target platforms, you can avoid unnecessary build attempts for platform-specific packages that are not applicable to your use case. This can be achieved through uv's configuration settings that allow you to specify your target platforms, thus streamlining the dependency resolution process and preventing irrelevant build failures."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy should I adopt if a package build fails because it does not support all Python versions I intend to support?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a package build fails because it lacks support for all Python versions you aim to support, the recommended strategy is to use **markers to conditionally specify different package versions based on Python version**. For packages like `numpy` that support a limited range of Python versions at any time, you should split your dependency declaration using markers in your requirements files. For example, to support Python 3.8 to 3.13 with `numpy`, you could specify:\n\n```\nnumpy>=1.23; python_version >= \"3.10\"\nnumpy<1.23; python_version < \"3.10\"\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that appropriate `numpy` versions are selected based on the Python version being used, avoiding build failures due to version incompatibility."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I handle a build failure in uv when a package is only usable on a specific platform and not relevant to my current environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you encounter a build failure in uv for a package that is only intended for a specific platform different from your current environment, you can use **manual dependency metadata** to skip the build. By providing dependency metadata manually, you essentially tell uv to bypass the build process for that package. This is particularly useful for platform-specific packages that are irrelevant to your current setup. However, it's crucial to ensure you specify correct metadata as uv cannot verify overridden information, and incorrect metadata might lead to resolution or runtime issues. This approach should be used cautiously and with accurate knowledge of your dependencies' platform relevance."}]}
