{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is npm ci different from npm install?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `npm ci` command differs from `npm install` in several key ways:\n\n1. **Package Lock Requirement:** `npm ci` mandates the presence of either a `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file in the project.\n2. **Dependency Consistency:** If the dependencies listed in the package lock file do not match those in `package.json`, `npm ci` will halt with an error, preventing unintended dependency updates. In contrast, `npm install` would attempt to update the package lock to reflect changes in `package.json`.\n3. **Project-Wide Installation:** `npm ci` is designed to install all dependencies for an entire project at once. It does not support adding individual dependencies like `npm install`.\n4. **Clean Installation:** If a `node_modules` directory exists, `npm ci` automatically removes it before initiating the installation process, ensuring a completely clean environment.\n5. **Frozen Dependencies:** `npm ci` never modifies `package.json` or any package lock files.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What must a project have for npm ci to work correctly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For `npm ci` to function correctly, a project **must** have either a `package-lock.json` or an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file at its root. These lock files are essential as `npm ci` relies on them to determine the exact versions of dependencies to install."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens if the dependencies in package-lock.json do not match package.json when using npm ci?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If `npm ci` detects discrepancies between the dependencies listed in `package-lock.json` (or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) and `package.json`, it will **exit with an error**. This behavior is intentional to prevent unintended updates to the package lock and to ensure that the installed dependencies strictly adhere to the lock file. This is unlike `npm install`, which would attempt to resolve these discrepancies by updating the package lock."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can npm ci be used to add individual dependencies to a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, `npm ci` **cannot** be used to add individual dependencies to a project. It is designed to install all dependencies of an entire project at once, based on the `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file.

You can do this by running a command like `npm config set legacy-peer-deps=true --location=project`. This will create or update a `.npmrc` file within your project directory, and committing this `.npmrc` file to your repository ensures that both `npm install` and `npm ci` will consistently use the specified flags."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is npm ci faster than npm install?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In many cases, `npm ci` can be faster than `npm install`, especially in automated environments. This is because `npm ci` is optimized for clean installations from a lock file. It skips certain steps that `npm install` performs, such as dependency resolution and updates to the lock file. By directly installing from the lock file and removing `node_modules` upfront, `npm ci` streamlines the installation process, potentially leading to faster and more predictable install times, particularly in CI/CD pipelines."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When should I use npm ci instead of npm install?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You should prefer using `npm ci` over `npm install` in scenarios where:\n\n* **Clean and Reproducible Builds are Crucial:** In automated environments like CI/CD, testing, and deployment, where consistent and predictable dependency installations are paramount.\n* **Speed is Important:** When you need faster dependency installations, especially in automated pipelines.\n* **Package Lock Integrity is Essential:** When you want to strictly enforce the dependency versions defined in your `package-lock.json` and prevent unintended updates.\n* **Installing Entire Projects:** When you are setting up a development environment or deploying a project and need to install all dependencies at once.\n\nFor local development and when you need to add or update individual dependencies, `npm install` remains the more appropriate command."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can npm ci be used for local development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While `npm ci` *can* be used for local development to ensure a clean install, it's generally **not the preferred command** for day-to-day local development workflows. `npm install` is usually more suitable for local development because it allows for adding, updating, and removing individual dependencies, and it updates `package-lock.json` as needed. `npm ci`'s strengths lie in automated environments where its strict and clean installation behavior is most beneficial."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the prerequisites for using npm ci?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The key prerequisites for using `npm ci` are:\n\n1. **Presence of a Lock File:** You must have either a `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file in your project's root directory.\n2. **Matching Dependencies (Ideally):** Ideally, the dependencies in your `package-lock.json` should be consistent with those in your `package.json`. While `npm ci` will error out if there are mismatches, ensuring they are aligned beforehand is good practice.\n\nIf these prerequisites are met, `npm ci` can be effectively used for clean and consistent dependency installations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "If npm ci removes node_modules, does it also clear the npm cache?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, `npm ci` removing the `node_modules` directory is separate from clearing the npm cache. `npm ci` focuses on ensuring a clean project installation by removing the project's dependencies, but it **does not automatically clear the global npm cache**. The npm cache is a separate storage location for downloaded packages, intended to speed up future installations. To clear the npm cache, you would need to use a separate command like `npm cache clean --force`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is it necessary to run npm install before running npm ci in a new project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a new project, it's **generally necessary to run `npm install` at least once** before using `npm ci`. This is because `npm install` is typically used to initially create the `package-lock.json` file (if it doesn't exist). `npm ci` relies on the presence of this lock file. So, the typical workflow for a new project would be to run `npm install` to generate the lock file and install initial dependencies, and then use `npm ci` for subsequent clean installations, especially in automated environments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens if package-lock.json is missing when running npm ci?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the `package-lock.json` (or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) file is missing when you run `npm ci`, the command will **fail and exit with an error**. `npm ci` explicitly requires a package lock file to function, as it's designed to perform deterministic installations based on the versions specified in the lock file. Without it, `npm ci` cannot proceed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use npm ci to update dependencies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, you **cannot** use `npm ci` to update dependencies. `npm ci` is specifically designed for clean installations based on the existing `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file. It will not update these lock files or resolve newer versions of dependencies. To update dependencies, you should use commands like `npm update`, `npm install <package>@latest`, or `npm install` (which might update the lock file based on `package.json` ranges). `npm ci` is meant to enforce the versions already locked in your lock file."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is npm ci suitable for production deployments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `npm ci` is **highly suitable for production deployments**. In fact, it's often recommended for production environments due to its focus on clean, consistent, and reproducible installations. By using `npm ci` in production deployments, you can ensure that the exact dependency versions tested and locked in your `package-lock.json` are deployed, reducing the risk of unexpected issues caused by dependency version discrepancies. Its speed and non-modifying nature regarding project files also make it a robust choice for production setups."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can npm ci install devDependencies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, by default, `npm ci` **installs both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`** listed in your `package.json` file. This is consistent with the typical behavior of npm in development and build environments. If you need to install only production dependencies (excluding `devDependencies`), you would typically use `npm install --production` or set the `NODE_ENV=production` environment variable during installation, but these options are not directly applicable to `npm ci` as it doesn't accept dependency-type flags.

If you created your `package-lock.json` using `npm install` with default settings or with flags like `--legacy-peer-deps`, `npm ci` will follow the peer dependency resolution and installation behavior established during that lock file creation. It's crucial that if you have specific peer dependency requirements or have used flags like `--legacy-peer-deps` with `npm install`, you maintain that consistency when using `npm ci` to avoid potential issues. This is why it's recommended to configure npm project settings (e.g., using `.npmrc`) to ensure consistent behavior across `npm install` and `npm ci`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use npm ci with a custom npm registry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you **can use `npm ci` with a custom npm registry**. `npm ci` respects npm configuration settings, including registry configurations. If you have configured npm to use a custom registry (e.g., through npm config, environment variables, or a `.npmrc` file), `npm ci` will fetch packages from that registry. This allows you to use `npm ci` in environments that rely on private or mirror npm registries, ensuring that dependency installations are performed using your specified registry settings."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does npm ci support npm workspaces?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `npm ci` **supports npm workspaces**. If you are working within an npm workspace project (a monorepo setup using workspaces), `npm ci` will correctly install dependencies for all projects defined in your `package.json` workspaces configuration, based on the root `package-lock.json` file. This makes `npm ci` suitable for monorepo setups where you need to ensure clean and consistent installations across multiple related projects within a workspace."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does npm ci use the npm cache to speed up installations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `npm ci` **does utilize the npm cache** to speed up installations. Like `npm install`, `npm ci` benefits from the npm cache mechanism. When downloading packages, npm first checks the cache to see if the required package version is already available locally. If it is, npm retrieves the package from the cache instead of downloading it again from the registry, significantly speeding up the installation process. This cache utilization is one of the reasons why both `npm install` and `npm ci` can be faster on subsequent runs, especially when dependencies have already been downloaded previously."}]}

If interrupted, the consequences depend on the stage of execution:\n\n* **Before `node_modules` Removal:** If interrupted very early, before `npm ci` starts removing the existing `node_modules` directory (if present), the project might remain in its previous state, or the installation might be in an inconsistent intermediate state.\n* **During `node_modules` Removal or Installation:** If interrupted during `node_modules` removal or package installation, the `node_modules` directory could be partially removed or incompletely populated. This can lead to an inconsistent and broken dependency state, requiring you to re-run `npm ci` (or `npm install`) to ensure a clean and complete installation.\n\nIn general, interrupting `npm ci` can leave your project in an undefined dependency state, so it's best to allow `npm ci` to run to completion to guarantee a consistent and clean installation."}]}
