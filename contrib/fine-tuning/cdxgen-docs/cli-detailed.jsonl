{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cdxgen is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to generate Bill-of-Materials (BOM) documents. It can take source code, container images, or binary artifacts as input and produce a comprehensive inventory of all software components and their dependencies.\n\nThe generated SBOM follows the CycloneDX specification and is crucial for a variety of software supply chain security use cases, such as vulnerability management, license compliance, and security policy enforcement within build pipelines."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the main inputs for cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cdxgen is versatile and accepts three primary types of input to generate a Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM). The first is Source Code, where cdxgen analyzes project manifest files (like package.json or pom.xml) and source files to identify dependencies. The second input type is a Container Image, where it inspects the image layers and installed packages to list its components.\n\nLastly, cdxgen can process Binary Artifacts. This allows you to generate an SBOM for compiled applications or libraries even without access to the original source code. This flexibility enables SBOM generation at different stages of the software development and deployment lifecycle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What can I do with the SBOM generated by cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An SBOM generated by cdxgen is a foundational asset for numerous software supply chain management activities. One major use case is Vulnerability Management. By uploading the SBOM to a platform like Dependency-Track, you can continuously monitor your application's components for newly discovered vulnerabilities.\n\nAnother key use case is License Compliance, where the SBOM helps identify all licenses used by your dependencies, ensuring you comply with their terms. Additionally, the SBOM can be used in CI/CD pipelines. For instance, a tool like 'depscan' can be invoked to analyze the SBOM and fail a build if critical vulnerabilities are found, enforcing a 'shift-left' security approach."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I install cdxgen using npm?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can install cdxgen globally on your system using the Node Package Manager (npm). Installing it globally makes the `cdxgen` command available from any directory in your terminal. You will likely need administrative privileges to install a package globally.\n\nThe command to perform the installation is: `sudo npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen`. The `sudo` prefix is used to grant administrative rights for the installation, `-g` specifies that it should be a global install, and `@cyclonedx/cdxgen` is the official package name on the npm registry."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a way to install cdxgen for Homebrew users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, if you are a macOS user who uses Homebrew as a package manager, there is a convenient way to install cdxgen. The tool is available as a formula in the official Homebrew repository, which simplifies installation and updates.\n\nTo install cdxgen using Homebrew, simply open your terminal and execute the command: `brew install cdxgen`. Homebrew will handle the download, compilation, and linking, making the `cdxgen` command immediately available in your shell."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I run cdxgen using Docker?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, cdxgen is available as a container image, which allows you to run it without installing it directly on your host machine. This is useful for maintaining a clean development environment or for integrating cdxgen into container-based CI/CD pipelines. The official image is hosted on GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).\n\nThe command to run cdxgen via Docker is: `docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app:rw -t ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen -r /app -o /app/bom.json`. This command mounts the current directory (`$(pwd)`) into the container's `/app` directory, runs the scan recursively (`-r /app`), and saves the output to `bom.json` in your current directory on the host."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the command `cdxgen -h` do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The command `cdxgen -h` (or its longer form, `cdxgen --help`) is used to display the help menu for the cdxgen command-line tool. This is a standard convention for many CLI applications to provide users with a quick reference guide.\n\nThe help output lists all available commands, such as `completion`, and all possible options (flags) you can use with cdxgen. For each option, it provides a brief description of its function, whether it's a boolean or takes a value, its default value, and any available choices. It also includes usage examples at the end, making it an essential first step for learning how to use the tool."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify the output file for the generated SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To specify a custom name and location for the generated SBOM file, you use the `-o` or `--output` option. By default, cdxgen saves the SBOM to a file named `bom.json` in the current working directory.\n\nFor example, if you want to name your output file `my-project-sbom.json` and save it in a specific directory like `/tmp`, you would run a command like this: `cdxgen -o /tmp/my-project-sbom.json .`. This gives you full control over where the final SBOM document is stored."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I tell cdxgen what type of project I am scanning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can explicitly tell cdxgen the type of project to scan for using the `-t` or `--type` option. This can improve the speed and accuracy of the scan by preventing cdxgen from trying to auto-detect the project type. You can specify multiple types by using the flag repeatedly.\n\nFor instance, to scan a Java project, you would use `cdxgen -t java .`. If your repository contains both Java and JavaScript code, you can specify both types like this: `cdxgen -t java -t js .`. A link to the complete list of supported project types is provided in the tool's help menu."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--recurse` flag do in cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--recurse` option instructs cdxgen to scan not only the specified directory but also all of its subdirectories. This feature is enabled by default and is particularly useful for mono-repos, where a single repository might contain multiple independent projects, each in its own subfolder.\n\nIf you want to limit the scan to only the top-level directory and ignore any nested projects, you need to explicitly disable this behavior. You can do this by using the `--no-recurse` flag. For example: `cdxgen --no-recurse .` will only analyze the manifest files present in the current directory."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is it possible to print the SBOM to the console in a readable format?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, cdxgen provides a way to view the SBOM contents in a human-readable format directly in your terminal, instead of just saving it as a JSON file. This is useful for quick checks and reviews of the generated component list.\n\nTo do this, you use the `-p` or `--print` flag. When this option is used, cdxgen will output the SBOM as a nicely formatted table with a dependency tree structure. For example, `cdxgen -p .` will scan the current directory and print the resulting SBOM to the console."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I automatically upload an SBOM to Dependency Track?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cdxgen has built-in support for uploading the generated SBOM directly to a Dependency-Track instance. To use this feature, you need to provide the URL of your server and an API key for authentication.\n\nYou use the `--server-url` option to specify the location of your Dependency-Track server and the `--api-key` option for your authentication key. You'll also need to specify the project using either `--project-id` for an existing project, or `--project-name` and `--project-version` to create a new one. A typical command would look like: `cdxgen . --server-url http://dep-track.local --api-key <your_key> --project-name my-app --project-version 1.0.0`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I install cdxgen using Deno?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` supports installation via the Deno runtime. Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. Installing with Deno requires you to grant specific permissions for the script to run securely.\n\nThe full command for installing `cdxgen` with Deno is:\n`deno install --allow-read --allow-env --allow-run --allow-sys=uid,systemMemoryInfo,gid,homedir --allow-write --allow-net -n cdxgen \"npm:@cyclonedx/cdxgen/cdxgen\"`.\nThis command downloads the npm package, resolves its dependencies, and installs `cdxgen` as an executable script on your system, while granting it the necessary permissions for file access, network requests, and running sub-processes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a Deno-specific Docker image for cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, in addition to the standard Node.js-based Docker image, there is also a Deno-specific version available. This image uses the Deno runtime instead of Node.js to execute `cdxgen`. This might be preferable in environments that are standardized on Deno.\n\nThe Deno version of the container image is named `ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen-deno`. You can use it with the same Docker command structure as the standard image, simply by replacing the image name: `docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app:rw -t ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen-deno -r /app -o /app/bom.json`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I use cdxgen as a library in a Deno application?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cdxgen can be directly integrated into your Deno applications as a library, allowing you to programmatically create and manage SBOMs. This is achieved by importing functions from the `cdxgen` npm package using Deno's npm specifier support.\n\nYou can import functions like `createBom` and `submitBom` directly into your TypeScript or JavaScript code. For example, a Deno script could include the line: `import { createBom, submitBom } from \"npm:@cyclonedx/cdxgen\";`. This allows you to call these functions within your application to generate an SBOM from a given path and even submit it to a service like Dependency-Track without shelling out to the CLI."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `--resolve-class` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--resolve-class` flag is a boolean option used to enrich the generated SBOM with more detailed information. When this flag is enabled, cdxgen will attempt to resolve and list the class names contained within packages.\n\nCurrently, this feature is primarily supported for Java Archives (JARs). Including class names can provide deeper insight into the code being used, which can be valuable for certain types of static analysis or for understanding the precise functionality being imported from a dependency."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When should I use the `--deep` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--deep` flag enables a more intensive and thorough search for software components. It's particularly useful in complex scenarios where dependencies might not be easily discoverable through standard manifest file analysis alone.\n\nYou should consider using the `--deep` flag when you are scanning C/C++ applications, as their dependency management is often less standardized. It is also highly recommended for generating SBOMs from live operating systems or from OCI (Open Container Initiative) container images, as it helps uncover system-level libraries and binaries that are part of the runtime environment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I provide my Dependency Track API key to cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To authenticate with your Dependency Track server, you need to provide an API key. cdxgen accepts this key through the `--api-key` command-line option.\n\nWhen you use this option, you pass the key as its value. For example: `cdxgen . --server-url <URL> --api-key DTRACK_API_KEY_HERE`. It is a security best practice to handle this key carefully, for instance by using environment variables or secrets management tools in your CI/CD pipeline, rather than hardcoding it directly in scripts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between `--project-name` and `--project-id` for Dependency Track integration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Both `--project-name` and `--project-id` are used to specify the target project in Dependency Track, but they serve different purposes. You typically use `--project-name` along with `--project-version` to identify a project. If a project with that name and version doesn't exist in Dependency Track, a new one will be created.\n\nThe `--project-id` option, however, refers to the unique identifier (UUID) of a project that already exists in Dependency Track. Using the project ID is more precise and avoids ambiguity. You should use `--project-id` when you want to ensure you are updating a specific, pre-existing project, whereas the name/version combination is useful for creating new projects or when you don't know the ID."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I generate an SBOM with only required dependencies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can generate a more concise SBOM that includes only the dependencies marked with a 'required' scope by using the `--required-only` flag. This is useful for focusing on the core, essential components of an application and filtering out optional, development, or testing dependencies.\n\nWhen you use `--required-only`, the composition's `aggregate` property in the SBOM is automatically set to `incomplete`. This correctly signals that the SBOM is not a complete representation of all components. You can override this behavior by also passing the `--no-auto-compositions` flag if you have a specific reason to do so."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--fail-on-error` flag do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--fail-on-error` flag changes how cdxgen behaves when it encounters a problem during the SBOM generation process. By default, cdxgen might report an error from a specific dependency extractor (e.g., for a certain language) but will continue trying to find other components and will still produce an SBOM with the data it successfully gathered.\n\nWhen you enable `--fail-on-error`, any failure in any dependency extraction step will cause the entire cdxgen process to terminate with a non-zero exit code. This is extremely useful in CI/CD pipelines, as it allows you to fail a build if the SBOM generation is incomplete or erroneous, ensuring that you don't proceed with a potentially inaccurate dependency list."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen sign the SBOM it creates?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, cdxgen has the capability to digitally sign the SBOMs it generates. This is a crucial security feature that provides authenticity and integrity, ensuring that the SBOM has not been tampered with since it was created.\n\nTo use this feature, you pass the `--generate-key-and-sign` flag. When this option is enabled, cdxgen will first generate a new RSA public/private key pair. It then uses the private key to sign the generated SBOM using the JSON Web Signatures (JWS) standard. This adds a layer of trust to your SBOM, which is important when sharing it with other parties."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I run cdxgen as a server?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cdxgen can be run in a persistent server mode, which is useful for creating a dedicated SBOM generation service. Instead of running a one-off scan, the server listens for requests and generates SBOMs on demand. To start cdxgen in server mode, you simply use the `--server` flag.\n\nBy default, the server will listen on the local host (`127.0.0.1`) at port `9090`. You can customize this using the `--server-host` and `--server-port` options. For example, to run the server on all network interfaces on port 8000, you would use the command: `cdxgen --server --server-host 0.0.0.0 --server-port 8000`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does cdxgen automatically install dependencies for a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, for some project types, cdxgen has the capability to automatically install dependencies before scanning. This is the default behavior (`--install-deps` is true) because having the dependencies installed often leads to a more accurate and complete dependency graph.\n\nHowever, this feature is disabled by default for container and OCI image scans to avoid altering the image. If you wish to prevent cdxgen from automatically running commands like `npm install` or `pip install`, you can explicitly disable this feature by passing the `--no-install-deps` flag. This is useful in environments with restricted network access or when you want to ensure the dependency installation is handled by a separate, controlled step in your pipeline."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I disable SBOM validation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By default, cdxgen validates the generated SBOM against the official CycloneDX JSON schema. This ensures that the output file is well-formed and compliant with the specification version you are using. This feature is controlled by the `--validate` flag, which is set to true by default.\n\nIf you need to disable this validation step for any reason, such as for performance or because you are working with a custom extension to the schema, you can do so by using the boolean `--no` prefix. The command to disable validation would be `cdxgen --no-validate .`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I specify the CycloneDX specification version?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cdxgen allows you to choose the version of the CycloneDX specification for the output SBOM. This is useful for maintaining compatibility with different tools in your toolchain that may expect a specific version of the standard. The default version used by cdxgen is 1.6.\n\nTo select a different version, you use the `--spec-version` option followed by the desired version number. The currently supported choices are 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6. For example, to generate an SBOM compliant with CycloneDX v1.5, you would use the command: `cdxgen --spec-version 1.5 .`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are BOM profiles and how do I use them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BOM profiles in cdxgen allow you to tailor the generated SBOM for a specific use case. Different use cases may require different types of information, and profiles help to include the most relevant data. The default profile is 'generic'.\n\nTo use a specific profile, you use the `--profile` option. For example, if you are generating an SBOM for a machine learning project, you might use the `ml` or `machine-learning` profile: `cdxgen --profile ml .`. Other available profiles include `appsec`, `research`, `operational`, `license-compliance`, and `threat-modeling`, each designed to optimize the SBOM for its respective purpose."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I exclude certain files or directories from a cdxgen scan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can prevent cdxgen from scanning specific files or directories by using the `--exclude` option. This is useful for ignoring test directories, documentation, or other non-runtime assets to create a cleaner and more accurate SBOM. The option accepts one or more glob patterns for matching.\n\nFor example, to exclude all `node_modules` directories and all files inside any `test` folders, you could use a command like this: `cdxgen --exclude \"**/node_modules/**\" --exclude \"**/test/**\" .`. This gives you fine-grained control over the scope of the scan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I make the output JSON from cdxgen pretty-printed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By default, cdxgen generates the SBOM JSON in a compact, single-line format, which is optimized for machine processing. However, for manual inspection and debugging, a more human-readable, indented format is often preferred. \n\nTo get this 'pretty-printed', JSON output, you can use the `--json-pretty` flag. When you add this boolean flag to your command, like `cdxgen --json-pretty .`, the resulting `bom.json` file will be formatted with proper indentation and line breaks, making it much easier to read."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the command to generate an SBOM for both Java and JavaScript in a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To generate a single, comprehensive SBOM for a project that contains both Java and JavaScript code, you can specify both project types using the `-t` flag multiple times in the same command. cdxgen will then run the appropriate analyzers for each language.\n\nThe command would be: `cdxgen -t java -t js .`. This tells cdxgen to look for Java dependencies (e.g., in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`) and JavaScript dependencies (e.g., in `package.json`) within the current directory (`.`) and its subdirectories, and combine the results into one SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the example command `cdxgen -t python --profile research .`"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This command instructs `cdxgen` to perform a scan tailored for a specific purpose on a Python project. Let's break it down: `cdxgen` is the tool being invoked. The `-t python` part explicitly tells `cdxgen` to use its Python language analyzer, looking for files like `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.\n\nThe `--profile research` part is key. It modifies the SBOM generation to include information that is particularly useful for application security research. This might involve collecting more detailed evidence or metadata about the components. Finally, `.` indicates that the scan should start in the current directory."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does cdxgen handle boolean arguments like `--validate`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cdxgen follows a common CLI convention for handling boolean arguments. Most boolean flags are enabled by default (set to `true`), such as `--recurse`, `--install-deps`, and `--validate`. To disable such a feature, you prefix the argument with `--no-`.\n\nFor example, the `--validate` option is on by default. To turn it off, you would use `--no-validate`. Similarly, to disable recursion, you would use `--no-recurse`. This `--no` prefix provides a clear and intuitive way to toggle the behavior of these boolean flags from their default state."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I check the version of my installed cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To check the installed version of the cdxgen tool, you can use the `-v` or `--version` flag. This is a quick way to confirm which version you are running, which can be important for debugging or ensuring compatibility.\n\nSimply open your terminal and run the command `cdxgen -v`. The tool will print its version number to the console and then exit, without performing any scan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Where can I find a list of all project types supported by cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The help output of cdxgen provides a direct link to the documentation that lists all supported project types. When you run `cdxgen -h`, look for the description of the `-t, --type` option.\n\nIn that description, it says: `Project type. Please refer to https://cyclonedx.github.io/cdxgen/#/PROJECT_TYPES for supported languages/platforms.` You can visit this URL in your web browser to get the most up-to-date and complete list of languages, platforms, and frameworks that cdxgen can analyze."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I filter the components included in the SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, cdxgen provides two powerful options for filtering the components that appear in the final SBOM: `--filter` and `--only`. The `--filter` option allows you to exclude components based on a keyword. Any component whose purl (Package URL) or properties contain the specified word will be removed from the SBOM. You can use this option multiple times for multiple keywords.\n\nThe `--only` option does the opposite. It includes *only* the components whose purl contains the specified word. This is particularly useful for creating an SBOM of just your first-party components by filtering on your company's namespace or group ID. Like `--filter`, it can be used multiple times."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `--include-formulation` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--include-formulation` flag enriches the SBOM by adding a `formulation` section. This section provides valuable metadata about how the software was built and from where the source code originated. This enhances the traceability and reproducibility of the software build.\n\nWhen enabled, cdxgen will include information about the build tools used (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm) and metadata from the source code management (SCM) system, such as git commit hashes, branch names, and repository URLs. This data is crucial for advanced use cases like build-to-source verification."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I include cryptographic libraries as components in my SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By default, some cryptographic libraries might be considered system-level or platform-level dependencies and may not be included in a standard SBOM. To ensure these components are explicitly listed, cdxgen provides the `--include-crypto` flag.\n\nWhen you add `--include-crypto` to your command, cdxgen will perform a specific scan to identify common cryptographic libraries and include them as distinct components in the SBOM. This is important for security compliance and for creating a Crypto Bill of Materials (CBOM)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen to attest to compliance with standards like ASVS?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, cdxgen allows you to embed attestations of compliance with various security standards directly into the SBOM. This is done using the `--standard` option. This feature is useful for formally declaring that a component has been evaluated against or developed in accordance with a specific set of requirements.\n\nThe `--standard` option accepts a list of predefined standards. For example, to attest to compliance with OWASP ASVS version 5.0, you would use `--standard asvs-5.0`. Other supported standards include NIST SSDF, BSIMM, and MASVS, among others."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--min-confidence` option control?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--min-confidence` option sets a threshold for the confidence level required for a component to be included in the SBOM. During its analysis, cdxgen assigns a confidence score (from 0 to 1) to each component it identifies, representing how certain it is about the component's identity (name, version, etc.).\n\nBy setting `--min-confidence`, you can filter out components that were identified with low certainty. The default value is 0, meaning all identified components are included. If you set it to a higher value, for example `--min-confidence 0.8`, only components with a confidence score of 80% or higher will be added to the final BOM. This can help reduce noise from speculative or uncertain findings."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I control the analysis techniques used by cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cdxgen allows you to specify which analysis techniques it should employ during a scan via the `--technique` option. By default, it uses an `auto` mode where it selects the most appropriate techniques based on the input type. However, for specific use cases, you may want to restrict or prioritize certain methods.\n\nAvailable techniques include `source-code-analysis`, `binary-analysis`, `manifest-analysis`, `hash-comparison`, `instrumentation`, and `filename`. You can provide one or more of these values. For instance, `cdxgen --technique manifest-analysis .` would force cdxgen to only look at manifest files like `package.json` and ignore other methods, potentially resulting in a faster but less comprehensive scan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between cdxgen and Dependency Track shown in the overview diagram?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The overview diagram illustrates a typical workflow where `cdxgen` is the producer of an SBOM, and Dependency-Track is a consumer. `cdxgen` generates the SBOM from your source code or other assets. This SBOM is then ingested by Dependency-Track.\n\nDependency-Track uses the detailed component information in the SBOM to perform continuous analysis. As shown in the diagram, this enables key use cases like 'Vulnerability Management' (by matching components against a database of known vulnerabilities) and 'License Compliance' (by identifying and tracking the licenses of all dependencies). `cdxgen` even has built-in features to directly upload the SBOM to a Dependency-Track server."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I exclude certain project types from a recursive scan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can exclude specific project types during a scan, which is particularly useful in a recursive scan of a mono-repo. While `cdxgen` is scanning subdirectories, you might want it to ignore certain languages or frameworks. This is done using the `--exclude-type` option.\n\nFor example, if your repository contains Java, JavaScript, and Go projects, but you only want an SBOM for the Java and JavaScript parts, you could run: `cdxgen --exclude-type go .`. This tells cdxgen to perform its default recursive scan but to skip any directories or files that it identifies as being part of a Go project."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I set the author of the SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can specify the author(s) of the SBOM using the `--author` option. By default, the author is listed as \"OWASP Foundation\". However, if you are creating or modifying the BOM, it's good practice to claim authorship.\n\nTo set a custom author, you provide the name as a string. For example: `cdxgen --author \"Your Name or Organization\" .`. You can specify multiple authors by using the flag more than once."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen output the SBOM in a binary format?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, besides the standard JSON format, cdxgen can serialize and export the SBOM as a binary file using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf). Protobuf is often more compact and faster to parse than JSON, making it suitable for high-performance or low-bandwidth environments.\n\nTo enable this, you use the `--export-proto` flag. By default, the binary output will be saved to a file named `bom.cdx`. You can specify a different output file for the binary data using the `--proto-bin-file` option, for example: `cdxgen --export-proto --proto-bin-file mybom.bin .`."}]}

This is useful for modeling complex applications that are composed of multiple smaller projects or microservices. To do this, you use the `--parent-project-id` option.\n\nWhen you upload an SBOM for a project (the 'child'), you provide the UUID of the existing 'parent' project in Dependency Track using this flag. For example: `cdxgen . --server-url <URL> --api-key <KEY> --project-name my-service --project-version 1.0 --parent-project-id <PARENT_UUID>`.

By default, this action also sets the `compositions.aggregate` field in the SBOM to `incomplete`, which is a standard way to signal that the BOM is a partial representation of the project.\n\nHowever, if you also add the `--no-auto-compositions` flag, you override this automatic behavior. In this case, `cdxgen` will still filter for required-only dependencies, but it will *not* mark the composition as `incomplete`. You would only use this combination if you are certain that the 'required-only' view is, in fact, the complete and intended view of the components for your specific use case."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `--no-babel` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For JavaScript and TypeScript projects, cdxgen can use Babel, a popular JavaScript compiler, to perform more advanced static analysis. This analysis helps in identifying dependencies and can improve the accuracy of the generated SBOM, especially in projects with complex configurations or syntax.\n\nThe `--no-babel` flag allows you to disable this feature. You might want to do this for a few reasons: to speed up the scan, to avoid potential conflicts with your project's specific Babel version, or if you are running in an environment where Babel's peer dependencies are not available. Disabling it may result in a less detailed analysis for certain JavaScript/TypeScript projects."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of using the Docker container for cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Using the `cdxgen` Docker container offers several advantages over a local installation. First, it encapsulates `cdxgen` and all of its dependencies (like Node.js or Deno) into a single, portable image. This eliminates the need to install and manage these dependencies on your host machine, avoiding potential version conflicts. It ensures a consistent and reproducible execution environment, which is critical for CI/CD pipelines.\n\nSecond, it enhances security by isolating the scan process within the container. The provided Docker command uses volume mounts (`-v`) to give `cdxgen` access only to the necessary project directory, limiting its scope of access on the host system. This makes it a clean, reliable, and secure way to generate SBOMs in any environment that supports Docker."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the volume mounts in the provided cdxgen Docker command."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The example Docker command `docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v $(pwd):/app:rw ...` uses two volume mounts (`-v`) to share files between your host machine and the container. The first one, `-v /tmp:/tmp`, maps the host's `/tmp` directory to the container's `/tmp`. This is often required by `cdxgen` or its underlying tools for temporary file storage during analysis.\n\nThe second mount, `-v $(pwd):/app:rw`, is the most important one for your project. `$(pwd)` is a shell command that resolves to your current working directory on the host. This command maps your project directory to the `/app` directory inside the container. The `:rw` suffix grants the container read-write access to this directory, which is necessary for `cdxgen` to read your source code and write the output `bom.json` file back to your project folder."}]}

Other array-type options include `--exclude`, `--filter`, and `--only`, allowing you to provide multiple patterns or keywords for more complex configurations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How would I prevent cdxgen from analyzing my `target` directory in a Java project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prevent `cdxgen` from scanning the `target` directory, which typically contains compiled code and build artifacts in a Java Maven project, you should use the `--exclude` option. This option accepts a glob pattern to match files and directories you wish to ignore.\n\nTo exclude the `target` directory at the root of your project, you would use the command: `cdxgen --exclude \"target/**\" .`. The `\"target/**\"` pattern will match the `target` directory and everything inside it, ensuring that `cdxgen` focuses its analysis only on your source code and manifest files, leading to a more accurate source SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a profile for operational use cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` provides a profile specifically for operational use cases. You can select it by using the `--profile operational` flag. This profile is designed to generate an SBOM containing information that is most relevant to operations teams (e.g., DevOps, SREs).\n\nAn operational SBOM might emphasize details about a component's runtime environment, dependencies on external services, or other metadata useful for deployment, monitoring, and incident response. It helps operations staff to quickly understand the software composition of the systems they are managing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen in a Deno project without installing it globally?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can absolutely use `cdxgen` programmatically within your Deno project without a global installation. The documentation shows that `cdxgen` can be imported as a library directly into your Deno TypeScript or JavaScript code.\n\nBy using the `npm:` specifier, you can import functions like `createBom` from the `@cyclonedx/cdxgen` package. Your import statement would look like this: `import { createBom } from \"npm:@cyclonedx/cdxgen\";`. This approach bundles `cdxgen`'s functionality with your application, making your project self-contained and not reliant on a global tool being present on the system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I make the cdxgen server listen on all network interfaces?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By default, the `cdxgen` server (`--server`) listens only on the localhost address `127.0.0.1`, making it inaccessible from other machines. To make the server accessible over the network, you need to make it listen on all available network interfaces.\n\nThis is achieved by setting the listen host to `0.0.0.0` using the `--server-host` option. The full command would be: `cdxgen --server --server-host 0.0.0.0`. This tells the server to accept connections on any IP address assigned to the machine, which is necessary if you want to access it from other computers or containers on the same network."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does `--no-validate` do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--no-validate` flag disables the default behavior of validating the generated SBOM against the CycloneDX JSON schema. By default, `cdxgen` performs this check to ensure the output is a syntactically correct and valid CycloneDX document.\n\nYou might use `--no-validate` in specific scenarios, such as to slightly speed up the generation process, or if you are knowingly generating a non-standard SBOM for a specific purpose and want to bypass the validation errors. It effectively tells `cdxgen`: 'Generate the SBOM, but do not check it for schema compliance.'"}]}

This is important for maintaining compatibility with older tools that may not yet support the latest spec versions.\n\nTo generate a CycloneDX 1.4 SBOM, you must use the `--spec-version` option and provide `1.4` as the value. The command would be: `cdxgen --spec-version 1.4 .`. This ensures the structure and fields of the output JSON file adhere strictly to the 1.4 schema."}]}

The standard image is based on Node.js, which has historically been the primary runtime for `cdxgen`.\n\nThe `cdxgen-deno` image, on the other hand, is based on the Deno runtime. This provides an alternative for users who prefer or have standardized on Deno for its features like improved security and native TypeScript support. While the functionality of `cdxgen` itself is the same, the choice of image depends on the user's preferred or existing technology stack."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I prevent `cdxgen` from attempting to install dependencies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By default, `cdxgen` may attempt to automatically install a project's dependencies (e.g., by running `npm install`) to create a more accurate dependency graph. This behavior is controlled by the `--install-deps` boolean flag, which is on by default.\n\nTo prevent `cdxgen` from running any installation commands, you need to explicitly disable this feature. You can do this by using the `--no-install-deps` flag in your command. For example: `cdxgen --no-install-deps .`. This is a good practice in locked-down CI environments or when you want to ensure the dependency state is managed by a separate process."}]}

This is especially useful for mono-repos containing multiple projects. If you need to disable this, you must explicitly add the `--no-recurse` flag to your command."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify that a dependency is a child of another in Dependency Track via cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To create a parent-child relationship between projects within Dependency Track, you need to use the `--parent-project-id` option when uploading the SBOM for the child project. This tells Dependency Track to nest the new or updated project under an existing parent project.\n\nFirst, you would need the unique ID (UUID) of the parent project from your Dependency Track instance. Then, when generating the SBOM for the child component, you would use a command like: `cdxgen . --server-url <URL> --api-key <KEY> --project-name child-service --project-version 1.0 --parent-project-id PARENT_PROJECT_UUID`. This correctly establishes the hierarchical relationship in Dependency Track's project view."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--json-pretty` flag do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--json-pretty` flag is a boolean option that controls the formatting of the output SBOM JSON file. By default, `cdxgen` produces a minified JSON file, where all the data is on a single line without extra spaces or line breaks. This format is efficient for machines to parse.\n\nWhen you add the `--json-pretty` flag to your command, it tells `cdxgen` to format the output with indentation and newlines. This makes the resulting JSON file much more human-readable, which is very helpful for debugging, manual inspection, or when you need to review the contents of the SBOM."}]}

This option excludes any component that matches the provided keyword.\n\nThe command would be: `cdxgen --filter test .`. This will generate an SBOM that includes all discovered components *except* for those that have 'test' as a substring in their identifying information. You can use this flag multiple times to filter on several different keywords."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does cdxgen use Babel for JavaScript projects by default?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` does attempt to use Babel for deeper analysis of JavaScript and TypeScript projects by default. Babel can help `cdxgen` better understand the code and its dependencies, especially when modern syntax or complex module resolution is involved.\n\nThis behavior can be turned off if needed. The `--no-babel` flag exists specifically to disable the use of Babel during the scan. This might be necessary to avoid conflicts or speed up the process, though it could potentially reduce the accuracy of the scan for some JS/TS projects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--deep` flag help with for container image scans?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For container image scans (specifically OCI images), the `--deep` flag enables a more exhaustive analysis. A standard scan might only look at the package manager's database (like `apt` or `rpm`) to list installed software. However, a container image contains much more than that, including system libraries, statically linked binaries, and software installed from source.\n\nThe `--deep` search instructs `cdxgen` to perform a more thorough inspection of the container's entire filesystem. It actively looks for binaries and other artifacts that are not registered with the package manager, resulting in a much more complete and accurate SBOM of everything that is actually inside the container."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use environment variables for the Dependency Track API key?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While the `cdxgen -h` output focuses on the `--api-key` command-line argument, `cdxgen` also supports using environment variables for configuration, which is a common best practice for sensitive data like API keys. You can typically set the `DEP_TRACK_API_KEY` environment variable.\n\nBy setting this environment variable (`export DEP_TRACK_API_KEY='your_key_here'`), you can run the `cdxgen` command without having to pass the `--api-key` flag directly on the command line. This prevents the key from being exposed in your shell history or process list. The tool will automatically pick up the key from the environment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the command to generate a Python SBOM for appsec research?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To generate an SBOM for a Python project that is specifically geared towards application security (appsec) research, you should combine the project type flag with the `research` profile. This ensures `cdxgen` focuses on Python dependencies and includes data relevant to security analysis.\n\nThe command, as shown in the examples, is: `cdxgen -t python --profile research .`. The `-t python` part targets Python's dependency files (like `requirements.txt`). The `--profile research` part customizes the SBOM output to be more useful for researchers, potentially including more detailed evidence or component metadata."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the default output filename if I don't use the -o flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you run `cdxgen` without specifying an output file using the `-o` or `--output` option, the tool will save the generated Software Bill-of-Materials to a default filename.\n\nAs indicated in the help text, the default output file is `bom.json`. This file will be created in the current working directory from which you ran the `cdxgen` command."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I scan a mono-repo but exclude all JavaScript projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To scan a mono-repo and generate a comprehensive SBOM for all supported project types *except* for JavaScript, you should use the `--exclude-type` option. Since recursion is on by default, `cdxgen` will scan all subdirectories.\n\nThe command to achieve this would be: `cdxgen --exclude-type js .`. When `cdxgen` encounters any JavaScript-related manifest files (like `package.json`), it will ignore them and will not include any JavaScript components in the final SBOM. This allows you to selectively focus on other languages like Java, Python, or Go within the same repository."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen resolve Java class names in the SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` has a feature to resolve and include the names of Java classes within the generated SBOM. This provides a much more granular view of the code being used from each JAR dependency. This feature is not enabled by default.\n\nTo enable it, you must use the `-c` or `--resolve-class` flag. The help text notes that this feature currently works for JARs. Adding this flag, as in `cdxgen -c .`, will result in an enriched SBOM containing the class-level details for your Java dependencies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens if a dependency extractor fails during a scan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By default, if one of the internal dependency extractors in `cdxgen` fails (for example, if it encounters a malformed manifest file for one language), `cdxgen` will report the error but will continue its operation. It will try to extract dependencies using other methods or for other languages and will still produce an SBOM with the information it was able to gather.\n\nThis behavior can be changed with the `--fail-on-error` flag. If you enable this flag, any failure from any dependency extractor will cause the entire `cdxgen` process to stop immediately and exit with an error code. This is the recommended behavior for CI/CD pipelines to ensure data integrity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I run cdxgen if I installed it via brew?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you installed `cdxgen` using Homebrew with the `brew install cdxgen` command, using it is very straightforward. The installation process automatically places the `cdxgen` executable into a directory that is part of your system's PATH.\n\nThis means you can run the tool from any directory in your terminal simply by typing `cdxgen` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, you can navigate to your project's directory and run `cdxgen .` to start a scan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between `--filter` and `--exclude`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Both `--filter` and `--exclude` are used to remove things from the scan, but they operate at different levels. The `--exclude` option works at the file system level. You provide it with glob patterns (e.g., `\"**/test/**\"`) to prevent `cdxgen` from even looking at certain files or directories during its initial search.\n\nThe `--filter` option, on the other hand, operates on the component level *after* discovery. `cdxgen` will find all components, and then `--filter` will remove any component from the final list if its purl or properties match the given keyword. So, `--exclude` prevents files from being scanned, while `--filter` removes already-found components from the final SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen include build tool information in the SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can include information about the build environment and tools used to create the software.

This feature is controlled by the `--include-formulation` flag.\n\nWhen you enable `--include-formulation`, `cdxgen` will add a `formulation` section to the SBOM. This section is designed to hold metadata about the build process, including details about the build tools that were detected (like Maven, Gradle, npm, etc.). This information is valuable for understanding how the software was constructed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use `cdxgen` to generate an SBOM for a `Dockerfile`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While `cdxgen` can analyze a built container image, it doesn't directly parse a `Dockerfile`. A `Dockerfile` is a set of instructions for building an image, not the image itself. The correct workflow is to first build the image using the `Dockerfile` (e.g., with `docker build`), and then point `cdxgen` at the resulting container image tag or ID.\n\nWhen `cdxgen` scans the built image, it will analyze the resulting filesystem and installed packages, effectively giving you an SBOM of the final product defined by the `Dockerfile`. For best results, especially for container images, using the `--deep` flag is often recommended."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the `--print` option compatible with saving to a file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `-p` or `--print` option is primarily for displaying the SBOM in a human-readable table format directly to your console's standard output. When you use `-p`, the primary output of the tool is this table view.\n\nTypically, you would use either `-p` to view the SBOM or `-o` to save it as a JSON file, but not both in the same way. If you want both, you could run the command twice, once with each flag. Alternatively, you could redirect the standard output of the print command to a file (`cdxgen -p . > sbom_table.txt`) while still generating the JSON file with `-o` in the same command."}]}

First, performance: invoking Babel adds an extra processing step, so disabling it can speed up the scan, which might be important in rapid CI/CD cycles.\n\nSecond, compatibility: your project might use a very specific or unusual Babel configuration that could conflict with how `cdxgen` attempts to use it, leading to errors. By using `--no-babel`, you revert to a more basic but more robust analysis method that avoids these potential conflicts. It provides a fallback for projects where the Babel integration doesn't work smoothly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does `--rm` do in the `docker run` command for cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the `docker run` command provided in the documentation, the `--rm` flag is a standard Docker option that stands for 'remove'. It's a convenience flag for container lifecycle management.\n\nWhen you use `--rm`, Docker will automatically delete the container's file system after the container exits. This is ideal for short-lived, task-oriented containers like `cdxgen`, which you run to perform a single job (generating an SBOM) and then don't need anymore. It prevents your system from accumulating a large number of stopped containers, keeping your Docker environment clean."}]}

This means the option does not take a value; its mere presence on the command line toggles a feature on or off.\n\nFor example, `--print` is marked as `[boolean]`. You simply add `--print` to the command to enable it. Many boolean flags in `cdxgen` also support a `--no-` prefix to explicitly set them to false, such as using `--no-validate` to disable the default validation behavior."}]}

It's a way of labeling or classifying projects that are related but not necessarily hierarchical.\n\n`--parent-project-id`, on the other hand, creates a direct structural relationship. You provide the unique ID of another project, and the current project becomes a 'child' of that parent.

The documentation explicitly mentions this installation method.\n\nThe formula name is simply `cdxgen`. You can install it by running the command `brew install cdxgen` in your terminal. This will download and install the tool and its dependencies, making it ready to use."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify multiple project types to exclude?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--exclude-type` option is an array-type flag, which means you can use it multiple times in a single command to exclude several different project types. This is useful when scanning a mono-repo with many different kinds of projects.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to scan a repository but ignore both Go and Rust projects, you would structure your command like this: `cdxgen --exclude-type go --exclude-type rust .`. `cdxgen` would then process all other supported project types it finds during its recursive scan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the default value for the `--min-confidence` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--min-confidence` flag is used to set a minimum confidence score for components to be included in the SBOM. This score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents 100% confidence in a component's identity.\n\nAccording to the help documentation, the default value for this option is `0`. This means that by default, `cdxgen` will include every component it identifies, regardless of how low the confidence score is. You would raise this value only if you want to filter out low-confidence or speculative findings."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen be used for license compliance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` is a powerful tool for license compliance. As shown in the overview diagram, one of the primary use cases for the SBOM it generates is 'License Compliance', often in conjunction with a platform like Dependency Track. `cdxgen` identifies all components and attempts to determine their licenses.\n\nThis information is recorded in the SBOM. When the SBOM is imported into a tool like Dependency Track, you can create policies to allow or deny certain licenses, identify license conflicts (e.g., a copyleft license in a proprietary product), and generate reports to ensure your software complies with all legal obligations. For best results, you can use the `--profile license-compliance` to create an even more detailed, license-focused SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `[number]` notation mean in the help text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the `cdxgen -h` help output, the `[number]` notation indicates that the option expects a numerical value as its argument. You need to provide a number after the flag.\n\nFor example, the `--spec-version` option is marked as `[number]` and expects a version like `1.5` or `1.6`. Similarly, `--min-confidence` is `[number]` and expects a value between 0 and 1. This notation helps the user understand the type of input required for each option."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I get a more readable JSON output from cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By default, `cdxgen` outputs the SBOM in a minified JSON format, which is a single line of text optimized for machine parsing. To get a more human-readable output, you should use the pretty-print option.\n\nTo do this, add the `--json-pretty` flag to your command. This will instruct `cdxgen` to format the JSON with standard indentation and line breaks, making it much easier to read and inspect manually. For example: `cdxgen --json-pretty . -o bom.pretty.json`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does cdxgen validate the SBOM by default?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` performs validation on the generated SBOM by default. The help text for the `--validate` option shows that its default value is `true`. This means that after creating the SBOM, `cdxgen` will automatically check it against the appropriate CycloneDX JSON schema to ensure it is well-formed and compliant.\n\nThis is a valuable quality control step. If you need to skip this for any reason, you must explicitly disable it by passing the `--no-validate` flag."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--api-key` option do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--api-key` option is used to provide an authentication credential when interacting with a remote server, specifically a Dependency-Track instance. Dependency-Track protects its API endpoints and requires a valid API key to allow actions like uploading an SBOM.\n\nWhen you use `cdxgen` to automatically push an SBOM to Dependency-Track, you must provide your key with this flag (e.g., `--api-key \"YOUR_SECRET_KEY\"`). This key is then sent with the request to authenticate your identity and authorize the upload operation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I make my build fail if SBOM generation has issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ensure your build process fails if there are any issues during SBOM generation, you should use the `--fail-on-error` flag. By default, `cdxgen` might encounter an error with one part of the scan but still produce a partial SBOM and exit successfully.\n\nUsing `--fail-on-error` changes this behavior. If any dependency extractor fails for any reason, `cdxgen` will immediately terminate and return a non-zero exit code. In a CI/CD pipeline, this non-zero code will be interpreted as a failure, causing the build to stop. This enforces a strict policy that a complete and valid SBOM is a requirement for a successful build."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I use cdxgen in a mono-repo?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Using `cdxgen` in a mono-repo (a single repository containing multiple projects) is its default and primary mode of operation. The key feature for this is recursion, which is enabled by default (`--recurse` is true).\n\nTo scan a mono-repo, you simply navigate to its root directory and run `cdxgen .`. The tool will automatically traverse all subdirectories, detect the different project types it finds (e.g., a Java service in one folder, a JavaScript frontend in another), and generate a single, comprehensive SBOM that includes the dependencies from all discovered projects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I choose which CycloneDX version to use?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you have control over which version of the CycloneDX specification is used for the output SBOM.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `-p` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `-p` flag, which is a shortcut for `--print`, changes the output format of `cdxgen`. Instead of generating a JSON file, this option tells `cdxgen` to print a summary of the SBOM directly to the console in a human-readable format.\n\nThe output is described as a `table with tree`, meaning it will display the components and their dependencies in a structured, hierarchical view. This is very useful for a quick manual review of a project's dependencies without needing to parse a complex JSON file."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify the project version for Dependency Track?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To specify the version of your project when uploading an SBOM to Dependency Track, you should use the `--project-version` option. This flag is crucial for tracking the evolution of your project's dependencies over time.\n\nYou would use it in conjunction with `--project-name`, like so: `cdxgen . --server-url ... --project-name my-app --project-version \"2.1.0-release\"`. This ensures that the SBOM is associated with the correct version of `my-app` within Dependency Track, allowing you to compare versions and see when new vulnerabilities were introduced."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is it possible to generate a zsh completion script?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the `cdxgen completion` command is designed to generate completion scripts for multiple shell types, including zsh. When you run the command, it will typically auto-detect your shell or you can specify it.\n\nFor zsh, you would generate the script and then add it to a directory in your `fpath` (function path). For example: `cdxgen completion > ~/.zsh/completion/_cdxgen` and ensuring that `~/.zsh/completion` is in your zsh `fpath`. This enables rich tab-completion for `cdxgen` commands and options in your zsh terminal."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the function of the `--only` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--only` flag is a powerful filtering option that creates an SBOM containing *only* the components that match a specific keyword in their Package URL (purl). This is essentially the inverse of the `--filter` flag, which excludes matching components.\n\nThis flag is particularly useful for creating an SBOM of your 'first-party' components. For instance, if your company's packages all have a purl containing `com.mycompany`, you could use `cdxgen --only com.mycompany .` to generate a BOM that lists only your own software and excludes all third-party open-source dependencies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I change the author of the generated SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To change the author of the generated SBOM from the default value of \"OWASP Foundation\", you need to use the `--author` option. This allows you to claim authorship for the SBOM you are creating.\n\nYou simply provide the desired author name as a string after the flag. For example: `cdxgen --author \"My Company Inc.\" .`. The `author` field in the resulting SBOM's metadata will then be set to \"My Company Inc.\". You can also use this flag multiple times to list several authors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen generate an SBOM in protobuf format?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` supports generating the SBOM in the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) binary format in addition to the standard JSON format. Protobuf can be more efficient in terms of size and parsing speed, which is beneficial in performance-sensitive applications.\n\nTo enable this output format, you use the `--export-proto` flag. By default, this will create a binary file named `bom.cdx`. You can customize the output filename using the `--proto-bin-file` option."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does `cdxgen` handle a project with both Java and JavaScript code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "`cdxgen` is capable of handling polyglot projects that contain code from multiple languages. To scan a project with both Java and JavaScript, you can explicitly specify both types using the `-t` flag multiple times.\n\nThe command would be `cdxgen -t java -t js .`. When executed, `cdxgen` will run its Java analyzer (looking for `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, etc.) and its JavaScript analyzer (looking for `package.json`, etc.). The results from both analyzers will be combined into a single, comprehensive SBOM that lists all dependencies from both ecosystems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `--server-url` option?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--server-url` option is used to specify the network address (URL) of your Dependency-Track server. This is the primary piece of information `cdxgen` needs to know where to send the generated SBOM when you want to use the automatic upload feature.\n\nThe URL should be the base address of your Dependency-Track instance, for example, `https://dtrack.mycompany.com`. You must provide this URL along with an `--api-key` and project information for the upload to be successful."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does cdxgen require npm to be installed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whether `cdxgen` requires `npm` depends on how you install and use it. If you install it via `npm` (`npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen`), then yes, you need `npm` and Node.js.\n\nHowever, the documentation provides several alternative installation methods that do not require `npm` on the host machine. You can use Homebrew (`brew install cdxgen`), Deno (`deno install ...`), or run it via a Docker container (`docker run ...`). These methods bundle the necessary runtime and dependencies, so you don't need to have Node.js or `npm` installed locally."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I tell cdxgen that my project is a Python project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To explicitly tell `cdxgen` that you are scanning a Python project, you should use the `-t` or `--type` option with the value `python`. This directs `cdxgen` to use its Python-specific analyzers.\n\nThe command would be `cdxgen -t python .`. This instructs `cdxgen` to look for common Python dependency files like `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile.lock`, or `poetry.lock` to determine the project's components. While auto-detection might work, specifying the type is more direct and can be more reliable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen to see if I'm using any crypto libraries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can use `cdxgen` to specifically identify and list cryptographic libraries in your project. This is a crucial step for security compliance and for creating a Crypto Bill of Materials (CBOM). To do this, you need to use a special flag.\n\nThe `--include-crypto` flag enables a specialized scan that looks for common cryptographic libraries and ensures they are included as components in the final SBOM. Without this flag, some crypto libraries might be missed or not explicitly identified."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `[choices: ...]` part mean in the help output?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the `cdxgen -h` help text, the `[choices: ...]` notation lists the specific, valid values that an option will accept. You must provide one of the values from this list for the option to work correctly.\n\nFor example, the `--spec-version` option shows `[choices: 1.4, 1.5, 1.6]`, meaning you can only use one of those three numbers as its value. Similarly, the `--profile` option has a long list of choices like `appsec`, `research`, `ml`, etc. This prevents user error by clearly defining the set of allowed inputs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I run cdxgen in a CI/CD pipeline?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Integrating `cdxgen` into a CI/CD pipeline is a common use case. The best method is often to use the official Docker container to ensure a consistent environment. In your pipeline script (e.g., in Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions), you would add a step that executes the `docker run` command.\n\nA typical pipeline step would look like: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app:rw -t ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen -r /app -o /app/bom.json`. For better pipeline control, you should also add the `--fail-on-error` flag to ensure the build fails if SBOM generation is unsuccessful. After this step, you can add another step to upload the `bom.json` to a platform like Dependency-Track or run `depscan` on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen to analyze a single file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can be pointed at a single file instead of a directory. This is most common when analyzing a binary artifact or a specific manifest file.\n\nFor example, if you have a Java archive, you could run `cdxgen my-app.jar`. `cdxgen` will recognize it as a JAR file and perform binary analysis on it to identify its contents and dependencies. Similarly, you could point it directly at a manifest file like `cdxgen package-lock.json` to generate an SBOM based only on that file's contents."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the default value of the `recurse` option?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The default value for the `-r` or `--recurse` option is `true`. This is explicitly stated in the help documentation provided for the `cdxgen` command-line tool.\n\nThis means that by default, `cdxgen` will operate in recursive mode, automatically scanning the target directory and all of its subdirectories for projects. To disable this and scan only the top-level directory, you must explicitly use the `--no-recurse` flag."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I get help on the cdxgen command?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To get help and see a full list of commands and options for the `cdxgen` tool, you can use the built-in help flag. This is a standard feature for most command-line applications.\n\nSimply open your terminal and type `cdxgen -h` or the more verbose version, `cdxgen --help`.

You would treat the application package as a 'Binary Artifact', which is a supported input type.\n\nFor a more accurate SBOM, it is often better to scan the source code of the mobile application before it is compiled. For example, you could scan the Java/Kotlin source for an Android app (`-t java`) or the Swift/Objective-C source for an iOS app (`-t swift`). The `masvs-2.0.0` standard available under the `--standard` option is also specifically for mobile app security, indicating mobile is a target use case."}]}

This is a powerful way to communicate the security posture of your application."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can `cdxgen` generate an SBOM for a project that has no dependencies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can generate a valid SBOM even for a project that has no external dependencies. The resulting SBOM would still contain important metadata about the project itself.\n\nThe SBOM would list the main project component (often called the 'root' component) with its name and version. The `dependencies` list for this component would simply be empty. This is still a valuable document, as it formally attests that the project has no third-party dependencies, which is an important piece of information for security and risk assessment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I use cdxgen if I have it installed locally in `node_modules`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you've installed `cdxgen` as a local project dependency (`npm install @cyclonedx/cdxgen`), it won't be available as a global command. Instead, its executable will be placed in your project's `node_modules/.bin` directory. There are two common ways to run it.\n\nFirst, you can run it via an npm script. Add a script to your `package.json`, like `\"scripts\": { \"sbom\": \"cdxgen .\" }`, and then run it with `npm run sbom`. Second, you can execute it directly by providing its path: `./node_modules/.bin/cdxgen .`. The `npx` command is also a great shortcut for this: `npx cdxgen .` will automatically find and run the local `cdxgen` executable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `--deep` flag for live OS scans?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When scanning a live operating system, the `--deep` flag is essential for achieving a comprehensive SBOM. A standard scan might only query the system's package manager (like `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu or `yum` on CentOS), which only knows about software installed through official packages.\n\nThe `--deep` flag enables a much more intensive search. It instructs `cdxgen` to scan the entire filesystem, looking for binaries, libraries, and other software that was installed manually, compiled from source, or is part of the base OS but not tracked by the package manager. This deep analysis is necessary to get a true and complete picture of all software running on the system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens if I provide a file path to the `-o` option that doesn't exist?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you provide a file path to the `-o` or `--output` option where the directory does not exist, the behavior will depend on the operating system and `cdxgen`'s implementation. In most cases, the command will fail.\n\n`cdxgen` will attempt to write the `bom.json` file to the specified path, but since the parent directory is missing, the file system will return an error (e.g., 'No such file or directory'). The `cdxgen` process will likely terminate with an error message. You must ensure that the destination directory exists before running the command."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen be used to find vulnerabilities directly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, `cdxgen` itself does not find vulnerabilities. Its sole purpose is to generate a Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM), which is a list of software components. It is a dependency analysis tool, not a vulnerability scanner.\n\nThe workflow, as shown in the documentation's diagram, is a two-step process. First, you use `cdxgen` to create the SBOM. Second, you use a different tool, such as `depscan` or a platform like Dependency-Track, to analyze that SBOM. These secondary tools take the component list from the SBOM and cross-reference it with vulnerability databases to find any known security issues."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference in output between `--print` and `--json-pretty`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--print` (`-p`) and `--json-pretty` flags produce fundamentally different types of output. The `--print` option generates a human-readable summary of the SBOM in a plain text table/tree format. This output is not machine-parseable and is intended only for quick visual inspection in a terminal.\n\nOn the other hand, `--json-pretty` generates a complete, valid CycloneDX SBOM in JSON format. The only difference between its output and the default output is formatting; it adds indentation and line breaks to the JSON to make it readable for humans. It is still a complete, machine-parseable SBOM file, unlike the output of `--print`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `ML-DEEP` profile?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `ml-deep` profile, which is an alias for `deep-learning`, is a specialized BOM profile for creating SBOMs for deep learning applications. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers.\n\nWhen you select this profile with `cdxgen --profile ml-deep .`, you are instructing `cdxgen` to gather information that is particularly relevant to the components of a deep learning system. This could include details about the specific neural network models being used, the datasets for training and testing, and the deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, providing a much richer BOM for this specific domain."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen on a project without a lock file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can often still generate an SBOM for a project even if it's missing a lock file (like `package-lock.json` or `poetry.lock`). However, the quality of the SBOM may be lower. Lock files provide a definitive, reproducible list of all dependencies, including transitive ones, and their exact versions.\n\nWithout a lock file, `cdxgen` will fall back to analyzing the manifest file (like `package.json` or `pyproject.toml`). This file often specifies version ranges rather than exact versions. `cdxgen` may attempt to resolve these ranges, or it may list the ranges themselves in the SBOM. For the most accurate SBOM, generating and committing a lock file as part of your development process is highly recommended."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I scan a project and ignore all `test` directories?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To scan a project while ignoring all directories named `test`, you should use the `--exclude` option with a glob pattern that matches these directories. This is a common requirement to avoid including testing-only dependencies in your production SBOM.\n\nThe appropriate glob pattern would match any directory named `test` anywhere in the project's file structure. The command would be: `cdxgen --exclude \"**/test/**\" .`. The `**/` part is a wildcard that matches any number of directories, ensuring that `test` folders are excluded no matter how deeply they are nested."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the default project version in Dependency Track if I don't specify one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you are uploading an SBOM to Dependency Track and do not provide a version using the `--project-version` flag, `cdxgen` will use a default value. The help text for this option states that the default is an empty string (`[default: \"\"]`).\n\nThis means that the project in Dependency Track will be created or updated with a blank or null version field. While this is allowed, it's a best practice to always provide a meaningful version (like a git tag or a semantic version number) to properly track the project's history."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I integrate cdxgen with GitHub Actions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` is very well-suited for integration with GitHub Actions. You can easily add a step to your workflow YAML file to generate an SBOM on every push or pull request. The recommended approach is to use the official Docker container for a consistent execution environment.\n\nYour GitHub Actions step might look like this:\n```yaml\n- name: Generate SBOM\n  run: |\n    docker run --rm -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/app:rw -t \\\n    ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen -r /app -o /app/bom.json\n```\nAfter this step, you can add another to upload the generated `bom.json` as a build artifact or send it to a vulnerability management platform."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `[boolean] [default: true]` notation signify?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The notation `[boolean] [default: true]` in the `cdxgen` help text provides two pieces of information about an option. The `[boolean]` part means it's a toggle flag that doesn't take a value; its presence enables a feature.\n\nThe `[default: true]` part means that the feature is turned ON by default. If you do nothing, the flag is considered active. To turn it off, you must explicitly use the `--no-` prefix. For example, `--recurse` has this notation, so recursion is on by default, and you must use `--no-recurse` to disable it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen to see if my dependencies are compliant with BSIMM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can use `cdxgen` to assert that your project is compliant with the Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM). The `--standard` flag includes `bsimm-v13` as one of its predefined choices.\n\nBy adding `--standard bsimm-v13` to your command, you are embedding a formal attestation into the SBOM. This doesn't automatically verify compliance, but it serves as a claim that you can make about your software's development process. This can then be used as evidence in audits or for internal tracking of your security maturity against the BSIMM framework."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I analyze a jar file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To analyze a single Java ARchive (JAR) file and generate an SBOM for it, you can simply pass the path to the JAR file as the main argument to `cdxgen`. `cdxgen` will recognize the `.jar` extension and treat it as a binary artifact.\n\nThe command would be `cdxgen /path/to/your/application.jar`. `cdxgen` will then perform binary analysis on the JAR file, inspecting its contents (including bundled dependencies in a fat JAR) to identify the components and create the SBOM. For more detailed information, you could also add the `-c` or `--resolve-class` flag to list the Java classes within the JAR."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can `cdxgen` be used for threat modeling?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "`cdxgen` can be a valuable starting point for threat modeling by providing a detailed inventory of a system's components. By using the specialized `--profile threat-modeling`, you can create an SBOM that is specifically enriched with data useful for this purpose.\n\nThis enriched SBOM can serve as a foundational document for a threat modeling exercise. Security analysts can use the detailed component list to identify potential attack surfaces (e.g., a library known to have parsing vulnerabilities) and reason about how components interact. The SBOM provides a structured, data-driven view of the system's composition, which helps in systematically identifying potential threats rather than relying on ad-hoc analysis."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a way to limit the scan to only the current directory and not its subdirectories?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can limit the `cdxgen` scan to only the current directory and prevent it from descending into subdirectories. This is controlled by the recursion feature, which is enabled by default.\n\nTo disable recursion, you must use the `--no-recurse` flag. The command `cdxgen --no-recurse .` will instruct `cdxgen` to only analyze the manifest files found in the current directory (`.`) and to completely ignore any projects that might exist in subfolders."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does cdxgen support npm, brew, and deno installations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the documentation confirms that `cdxgen` supports a variety of installation methods to suit different user preferences and environments. It can be installed using `npm` for users in the Node.js ecosystem, via `brew` for Homebrew users on macOS, and with `deno` for those using the Deno runtime.\n\nThis flexibility makes the tool accessible to a wide range of developers. In addition to these package manager installations, it can also be run via Docker, which is a platform-agnostic solution."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between the `ml-deep` and `ml-tiny` profiles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While both `ml-deep` (deep-learning) and `ml-tiny` are specialized profiles for machine learning SBOMs, they are designed for different levels of detail. The `ml-deep` profile is intended to be comprehensive, gathering rich, detailed information relevant to deep learning systems, which can result in a larger, more verbose SBOM.\n\nThe `ml-tiny` profile, as its name suggests, is designed to be lightweight. It would likely include only the most essential information needed for an ML BOM, omitting more extensive metadata or evidence. This would be useful in scenarios where a small, compact SBOM is a priority, such as in resource-constrained environments or for very high-level inventory purposes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I know what version of the CycloneDX spec is being used?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can determine which version of the CycloneDX specification is being used by checking the `cdxgen` command you are running and its help documentation. The help text for the `--spec-version` option explicitly states the default value.\n\nAccording to the provided documentation, the default is `1.6`. So, unless you use the `--spec-version` flag to override it (e.g., `--spec-version 1.5`), `cdxgen` will generate a v1.6 compliant SBOM. The version of the specification is also typically recorded in the metadata of the generated `bom.json` file itself, which you can inspect."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does `cdxgen` get the project name if I don't provide it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you are using the Dependency Track integration and do not explicitly provide a project name via the `--project-name` flag, `cdxgen` will infer it from its environment.\n\nThe help text for the `--project-name` option states that the `Default use the directory name`. This means `cdxgen` will look at the name of the folder it is currently scanning and use that as the default project name. For instance, scanning a folder named `/src/my-web-app` would result in a default project name of `my-web-app`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--no-auto-compositions` flag do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--no-auto-compositions` flag is an advanced option that modifies how `cdxgen` handles the `compositions.aggregate` field in the SBOM. By default, when you filter the BOM (e.g., with `--required-only`), `cdxgen` automatically sets `compositions.aggregate` to `incomplete` to signal that the BOM is a partial view.\n\nUsing `--no-auto-compositions` disables this automatic behavior. Even if you filter the BOM, `cdxgen` will not change the `aggregate` field from its default (`complete`). You should only use this if you have a specific reason to declare a filtered view as 'complete' for your purposes, as it goes against the standard interpretation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I make the `bom.json` file more readable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To make the `bom.json` file more readable for human eyes, you should use the `--json-pretty` flag when running `cdxgen`. By default, the JSON output is minified into a single line to save space, which is difficult to read.\n\nThe `--json-pretty` option formats the JSON output with standard indentation and line breaks. This structures the data in a clear, hierarchical way that is much easier to navigate and understand when you open the file in a text editor. The command would be `cdxgen --json-pretty .`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `instrumentation` analysis technique?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `instrumentation` choice under the `--technique` option refers to a dynamic analysis method for identifying software components. Unlike static analysis which inspects code and binaries at rest, instrumentation involves modifying the code or its environment to observe its behavior as it runs.\n\nIn the context of `cdxgen`, this could mean hooking into function calls or monitoring network activity at runtime to see which libraries or components are actually being loaded and used by the application. This technique can be very powerful for discovering dependencies that are loaded dynamically and would be missed by static analysis alone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen produce an SBOM that attests to MASVS compliance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can produce an SBOM that includes an attestation of compliance with the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS). This is a key feature for developers building and securing mobile applications.\n\nTo do this, you use the `--standard` flag with the appropriate value. The help text lists `masvs-2.0.0` as one of the available choices. Adding `--standard masvs-2.0.0` to your command will embed a formal claim within the SBOM that your mobile application project adheres to the MASVS v2.0.0 standard."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I generate an SBOM for appsec purposes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To generate an SBOM that is specifically tailored for application security (AppSec) use cases, you should use the `appsec` profile. This profile instructs `cdxgen` to include extra data and metadata that is particularly useful for security tools and analysts.\n\nYou would enable this by adding the `--profile appsec` flag to your command, for example: `cdxgen --profile appsec .`. The resulting SBOM will be optimized for tasks like vulnerability scanning, exploitability analysis, and overall security posture assessment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between an SBOM for 'appsec' vs 'research'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While both the `appsec` and `research` profiles are security-oriented, they likely cater to slightly different needs. The `appsec` profile is probably geared towards the operational needs of an application security team: vulnerability management, policy enforcement, and risk assessment for production software.\n\nThe `research` profile, as suggested by the example `cdxgen -t python --profile research .`, might be designed for security researchers who are conducting deeper, more exploratory analysis. This profile could include even more granular data, such as extensive code evidence, function call information, or other low-level details that would be useful for reverse engineering or discovering new vulnerabilities, but might be too verbose for a standard AppSec program."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I install `cdxgen` on a Mac?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For macOS users, the most straightforward way to install `cdxgen` is by using the Homebrew package manager. The documentation explicitly states that `cdxgen` is available as a Homebrew formula.\n\nFirst, ensure you have Homebrew installed on your Mac. Then, open your terminal and run the simple command: `brew install cdxgen`. Homebrew will handle downloading, installing, and adding `cdxgen` to your system's PATH, making it immediately available to run from any directory."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the benefit of using `--project-id` over `--project-name` in a CI/CD pipeline?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a CI/CD pipeline, using `--project-id` to upload SBOMs to Dependency Track is generally more robust than using `--project-name` and `--project-version`. The `--project-id` is a unique and immutable UUID, which guarantees that you are always updating the exact same project.\n\nUsing `--project-name` can be brittle. If the project name is ever changed in Dependency Track, or if there's a typo in your script, `cdxgen` might accidentally create a new project instead of updating the existing one. By fetching the UUID once and storing it as a secure variable in your CI/CD system, you create a much more reliable and less error-prone integration."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I create an SBOM that includes only dependencies with a confidence score of 90% or higher?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To create an SBOM that is filtered based on the confidence of component identification, you need to use the `--min-confidence` option. This option sets a minimum threshold for the confidence score (from 0 to 1) that a component must have to be included.\n\nTo include only components with a confidence score of 90% (0.9) or higher, you would add the following flag to your command: `cdxgen --min-confidence 0.9 .`. This will result in a cleaner SBOM that excludes any components that `cdxgen` identified with low certainty."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I generate an SBOM for my Deno project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To generate an SBOM for a Deno project, you would use `cdxgen` and specify `deno` as the project type. `cdxgen` has specific analyzers for Deno that understand its dependency management, including how it handles imports from URLs and `deno.json(c)` files.\n\nYou would run the command `cdxgen -t deno .` from the root of your Deno project. This will trigger the Deno-specific logic to analyze your import maps and source files, accurately identifying all remote and local dependencies to create a comprehensive SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen analyze dependencies in a pom.xml file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can absolutely analyze the dependencies defined in a `pom.xml` file.

It will then parse this file to identify all declared dependencies, including their group ID, artifact ID, and version, as well as transitive dependencies, and include them in the generated SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `hash-comparison` technique do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `hash-comparison` analysis technique, available via the `--technique` flag, is a method for identifying software components by calculating their cryptographic hash (like SHA-1 or SHA-256) and comparing it against a database of known component hashes.\n\nThis technique is very powerful for identifying components, especially in binary form, even if they lack clear naming or version metadata. If the hash of a file in your project matches the known hash of a specific version of a library (e.g., `log4j-2.17.1.jar`), `cdxgen` can confidently identify it. This is a key technique for binary analysis and for verifying the integrity of components."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--fail-on-error` flag help prevent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--fail-on-error` flag helps prevent the silent generation of incomplete or inaccurate SBOMs, which is a significant risk in an automated CI/CD pipeline. Without this flag, `cdxgen` might encounter an error (e.g., a parse failure on a malformed lockfile), log it, but still produce an SBOM with the remaining data it found and exit successfully.\n\nBy using `--fail-on-error`, you enforce a stricter policy. Any error during generation will cause the entire process to fail and stop the build. This ensures that you don't unknowingly pass a partial or incorrect SBOM downstream to your security scanning or compliance tools, which could lead to a false sense of security."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the default author 'OWASP Foundation'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The default author for SBOMs generated by `cdxgen` is set to \"OWASP Foundation\" because `cdxgen` is an official project of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). OWASP is a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving software security, and they are the stewards of both the `cdxgen` tool and the CycloneDX SBOM standard.\n\nSetting the default author to the foundation gives credit to the parent organization.

This path is the starting point for the scan. If you need to scan multiple, separate folders (that are not nested within each other), you would generally run the `cdxgen` command multiple times, once for each folder.\n\nHowever, if the folders are all under a common parent directory, you can simply run `cdxgen` on that parent directory. Since recursion is on by default, it will find and scan all the project folders underneath it, effectively combining their dependencies into a single SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is `manifest-analysis`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "`manifest-analysis` is one of the core techniques that `cdxgen` uses to discover dependencies. It can be selected specifically with the `--technique` flag. This technique involves parsing official package manager manifest and lock files.\n\nThese are files like `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for Node.js, `pom.xml` for Java Maven, `requirements.txt` for Python, and so on. These files contain a formal declaration of a project's direct and often transitive dependencies and their versions. Manifest analysis is typically the fastest and most reliable way to get a baseline inventory of a project's components."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I check if I'm using a vulnerable version of log4j?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can check for a vulnerable version of log4j using a two-step process with `cdxgen` and a vulnerability scanner. First, generate a complete SBOM of your Java application by running `cdxgen -t java .` in your project's directory.\n\nSecond, take the generated `bom.json` file and analyze it with a tool that consumes SBOMs and checks for vulnerabilities. For example, you could upload it to a Dependency-Track instance, or use a command-line scanner like `depscan`. These tools will compare the components listed in your SBOM, including log4j and its version, against a database of known vulnerabilities (like Log4Shell) and report if you are using an affected version."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `filename` analysis technique?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `filename` analysis technique, which can be selected using the `--technique` option, is a simpler method of component identification. It involves identifying potential components based purely on the names of the files found during the scan.\n\nFor example, if `cdxgen` finds a file named `jquery-3.6.0.min.js`, it can make a reasonable guess that this file corresponds to version 3.6.0 of the jQuery library. While not as reliable as manifest analysis or hash comparison, it can be a useful fallback technique for discovering 'vendored' or informally included dependencies that are not listed in any package manifest."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify a project group for Dependency Track?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To assign a project to a specific group within Dependency Track, you can use the `--project-group` option when running `cdxgen`. This helps in organizing your projects within the Dependency Track UI.\n\nYou provide the name of the group as a string. For example: `cdxgen . --server-url ... --api-key ... --project-name MyApi --project-group \"Backend Services\"`. When the SBOM is uploaded, the 'MyApi' project will be associated with the 'Backend Services' group."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use `cdxgen` for C/C++ projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can be used for C/C++ projects. The documentation specifically mentions that the `--deep` flag is useful when scanning C/C++ applications. Dependency management in C/C++ is often less standardized than in other ecosystems, so a simple manifest scan is usually not sufficient.\n\nBy running `cdxgen --deep .` on your C/C++ project, you enable more intensive analysis techniques that can discover libraries and dependencies by inspecting the source, makefiles, and binary artifacts. This provides a much more comprehensive SBOM for these types of projects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does cdxgen support protobuf binary export?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` supports exporting the generated SBOM in a binary format using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf). This is an alternative to the default JSON text format and can offer benefits in size and parsing speed.\n\nTo enable this feature, you use the `--export-proto` boolean flag. This will cause `cdxgen` to create a binary file, which defaults to `bom.cdx`. You can change the name of this file with the `--proto-bin-file` option."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens if I use both `--project-id` and `--project-name`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `cdxgen` help text for `--project-id` states: `Either provide the id or the project name and version together`. This implies that you should use one method or the other, not both simultaneously. The `--project-id` is a unique identifier and is the more precise way to specify a project.\n\nIf you were to provide both, the most likely behavior is that `cdxgen` would prioritize the `--project-id` since it is an exact reference and ignores the `--project-name` and `--project-version`. Using the ID is unambiguous, whereas a name and version could potentially match multiple projects or cause a new one to be created. To avoid confusion, you should only use one of these two identification methods."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the default profile for BOM generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The default profile used by `cdxgen` for BOM generation is `generic`. This is specified in the help text for the `--profile` option, which shows `[default: \"generic\"]`.\n\nThis means that if you run `cdxgen` without specifying a different profile, it will create a general-purpose SBOM with a standard set of information suitable for most common use cases. To create a more specialized SBOM, you would need to explicitly select another profile, such as `appsec` or `ml`."}]}

This provides excellent traceability from the SBOM back to the exact source code commit."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `-t` option?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `-t` option, which is short for `--type`, is used to explicitly specify the project type(s) that `cdxgen` should scan for. This can make the scanning process faster and more accurate than relying on auto-detection.\n\nFor example, `cdxgen -t java .` tells the tool to only run its Java analyzers. You can also use it multiple times, like `cdxgen -t java -t js .`, to scan for multiple specific types in a polyglot repository. A link to the full list of supported types is available in the tool's help menu."}]}

This allows you to build up a list of exclusion patterns, like `cdxgen --exclude \"**/node_modules/**\" --exclude \"**/test/**\" .`. Other examples of array-type options are `--type`, `--filter`, and `--author`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I install cdxgen with deno?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can install `cdxgen` using the Deno runtime by executing a specific `deno install` command provided in the documentation.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I trust an SBOM that hasn't been signed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An unsigned SBOM can still be very useful, but it lacks formal guarantees of integrity and authenticity. You can trust its contents as much as you trust the source that provided it to you and the channel through which you received it. If you generate it yourself in a trusted environment, you can be confident in its contents.\n\nHowever, a signed SBOM provides a much higher level of trust. A valid digital signature, like the JWS signature `cdxgen` can create with `--generate-key-and-sign`, cryptographically proves who created the SBOM (authenticity) and that it has not been tampered with since its creation (integrity). This is especially important when consuming SBOMs from third parties."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I generate a SBOM for a Java project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To generate a Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) for a Java project, you should use `cdxgen` and specify `java` as the project type. This tells `cdxgen` to look for common Java build system files like Maven's `pom.xml` or Gradle's `build.gradle`.\n\nThe simplest command, when run from the root of your Java project, is `cdxgen -t java .`. This will analyze your project's declared dependencies, resolve the dependency tree, and create a `bom.json` file in the CycloneDX format."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--skip-dt-tls-check` option do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--skip-dt-tls-check` option is a flag that tells `cdxgen` to disable TLS certificate validation when it communicates with a Dependency-Track server. You would use this in situations where your Dependency-Track instance is using a self-signed or otherwise untrusted TLS certificate, which is common in testing or internal development environments.\n\nWhile this flag allows the connection to succeed in such cases, it should be used with caution. Disabling TLS validation removes a layer of security and makes the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. It is not recommended for use in production environments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen generate an SBOM with only first-party components?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can be configured to generate an SBOM that contains only your first-party components. This is achieved using the `--only` filter, which includes components only if their Package URL (purl) contains a specific string.\n\nTo do this, you need to identify a common namespace or group ID in your component purls that identifies them as first-party. For example, if all your internal packages use the `com.mycompany` group ID, you would run: `cdxgen --only com.mycompany .`. This would produce an SBOM listing only those components and excluding all open-source and other third-party dependencies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `-r` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `-r` flag is the shorthand for the `--recurse` option in `cdxgen`. It controls whether the tool scans subdirectories within the target path. This feature is enabled by default.\n\nThis is particularly important for mono-repos, where a single repository contains multiple distinct projects. The recursive scan allows `cdxgen` to discover all of them and generate a comprehensive SBOM. If you wanted to disable this and only scan the top-level directory, you would use the `--no-recurse` flag."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I use cdxgen with a private npm registry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When `cdxgen` runs, it uses the environment's existing package manager configuration. If you need it to analyze a project that uses a private npm registry, you must first configure your local npm client to connect to that registry. This is typically done in a `.npmrc` file.\n\nYour `.npmrc` file would contain the URL of your private registry and any necessary authentication tokens. When `cdxgen` runs (especially if `--install-deps` is active), it will invoke `npm`, which will then automatically use the configuration from your `.npmrc` file to fetch packages from your private registry. `cdxgen` itself doesn't need any special flags for this; it relies on the underlying npm configuration."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I get a list of all available options for cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To get a complete and detailed list of all available options, flags, and commands for `cdxgen`, you should use the built-in help command.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen to generate an SBOM for a PHP project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` supports PHP projects. It is capable of analyzing PHP's dependency management ecosystem, which is primarily handled by Composer. It looks for the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files to identify dependencies.\n\nTo scan a PHP project, you would navigate to its root directory and run `cdxgen -t php .`. This tells `cdxgen` to specifically use its PHP analyzer to parse your Composer files and generate an accurate SBOM of all your PHP packages and their transitive dependencies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens if my project contains multiple lock files, like package-lock.json and yarn.lock?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a JavaScript project contains multiple lock files (e.g., both `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock`), it usually indicates an inconsistent dependency management setup. When `cdxgen` encounters this situation, its behavior may vary, but it will typically prioritize one lock file over the other based on a predefined order.\n\nGenerally, tools will prefer the lock file of the more commonly used package manager or the one that is more up-to-date. To ensure a predictable and accurate SBOM, it is a strong best practice to standardize on a single package manager for your project and only have one lock file in your repository."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen tell me the license of each dependency?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, a core feature of `cdxgen` and the CycloneDX SBOM format is to identify and record the license of each dependency. When `cdxgen` analyzes a component, it attempts to determine its license from the package metadata.\n\nThe resulting `bom.json` file will contain a `licenses` section for each component, typically listing the license by its SPDX identifier (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`). This information is fundamental for the 'License Compliance' use case, where tools like Dependency-Track can use the SBOM to enforce licensing policies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I create a pretty-printed JSON file named 'my-bom.json'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To create a pretty-printed JSON SBOM and save it to a custom filename, you need to combine two different flags in your `cdxgen` command. The `--json-pretty` flag controls the formatting, and the `-o` (or `--output`) flag controls the filename.\n\nThe correct command would be: `cdxgen --json-pretty -o my-bom.json .`. This tells `cdxgen` to scan the current directory (`.`), format the resulting JSON with human-readable indentation (`--json-pretty`), and save it to a file named `my-bom.json` (`-o my-bom.json`)."}]}

It means that you can only provide one of the listed numbers as the argument for `--spec-version`.\n\nIf you were to provide a different value, such as `1.3`, `cdxgen` would likely return an error because it's not in the list of supported choices. This helps prevent user error and makes it clear what versions of the CycloneDX specification the tool is capable of generating."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does cdxgen support scanning `requirements.txt` files?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` fully supports scanning Python's `requirements.txt` files. When you run `cdxgen` on a Python project (e.g., `cdxgen -t python .`), its Python analyzer will automatically look for `requirements.txt`.\n\nIt will parse this file to identify the direct dependencies of your project. If the dependencies are pinned to specific versions in the file, `cdxgen` can create a very accurate SBOM. It will also analyze other Python dependency files like `Pipfile` or `pyproject.toml` if they are present."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I prevent cdxgen from scanning my `.git` directory?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "`cdxgen` is generally designed to be aware of version control system directories like `.git` and will typically ignore them by default when scanning for project components. The `.git` directory contains metadata for version control, not software components that should be in an SBOM.\n\nHowever, if you want to be absolutely certain it is ignored, you can use the `--exclude` flag explicitly: `cdxgen --exclude \".git/**\" .`. Note that the `--include-formulation` flag *will* read from the `.git` directory to gather SCM metadata for the SBOM, but this is a separate process from scanning for dependencies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the easiest way to install cdxgen on macOS?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For users on macOS, the easiest and most recommended way to install `cdxgen` is using Homebrew, a popular package manager for the platform. This method simplifies installation, updates, and uninstallation.\n\nAssuming you have Homebrew installed, you just need to open your terminal and run a single command: `brew install cdxgen`. Homebrew will take care of the rest, and the `cdxgen` command will be available for you to use system-wide."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a 'binary artifact' in the context of cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the context of `cdxgen`, a 'binary artifact' refers to any piece of software that is in a compiled, non-source-code form. This can include a wide range of file types, such as executable files (`.exe`, ELF binaries), compiled libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.a`), or package formats like Java JAR files.\n\n`cdxgen`'s ability to take a binary artifact as input is a powerful feature. It allows you to generate an SBOM for software even when you don't have the original source code. It does this by using binary analysis techniques to inspect the artifact and identify the components within it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen in an air-gapped environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can use `cdxgen` in an air-gapped environment, but it requires some preparation. The main challenge is that `cdxgen` might try to access the network, for example, to download dependency metadata or if the `--install-deps` flag is active. To make it work offline, you need to control these factors.\n\nFirst, you should use the `--no-install-deps` flag to prevent any attempt to download packages. Second, you need to ensure that all necessary dependencies are already available locally (e.g., in a local cache like `.m2` for Maven or `node_modules` for npm). The Docker container version of `cdxgen` is also a good option, as you can load the Docker image into the air-gapped environment from a tarball. The core analysis can then run completely offline."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I analyze a project and only include required dependencies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To generate an SBOM that contains only the essential, required dependencies and excludes optional or development dependencies, you should use the `--required-only` flag. This flag filters the component list based on their scope.\n\nWhen you run `cdxgen --required-only .`, the resulting SBOM will be more concise, focusing only on the components necessary for the application to run. This is useful for creating a production-focused BOM. Note that this action will also correctly mark the SBOM's composition as `incomplete` to reflect the filtering."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `--server-host` option?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--server-host` option is used to specify the IP address or hostname that the `cdxgen` server should bind to when running in server mode (`--server`). The default value is `127.0.0.1` (localhost), which means the server is only accessible from the same machine.\n\nIf you want to make the server accessible to other machines on your network, you need to change this value.

For each component, it can list the other components that it directly depends on.\n\nWhen you import this SBOM into a tool that can visualize it, like Dependency-Track or some IDE plugins, you can see a full, interactive dependency graph. Additionally, the `--print` option in `cdxgen` itself provides a simple text-based tree view of this dependency graph directly in your terminal."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to handle the Dependency Track API key in a script?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best and most secure way to handle the Dependency Track API key in a script is to use an environment variable instead of hardcoding it or passing it directly as a command-line argument. Hardcoding the key exposes it in your source code, and passing it on the command line can expose it in your shell history or system process list.\n\nBefore running your script, you should set an environment variable, for example: `export DEP_TRACK_API_KEY=\"your-secret-key-here\"`. Most well-designed tools, including `cdxgen`, are built to automatically detect and use such environment variables.

This is often necessary because many command-line tools and the libraries they use need a temporary directory to store intermediate files during their operation.\n\nBy sharing the `/tmp` directory, `cdxgen` (or one of its underlying processes) can create temporary files and have them persist as needed during the scan. It ensures that the tool has a reliable temporary workspace, which can be important for complex analysis tasks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I have an SBOM for my SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a clever question about recursion in software supply chains. Yes, you can absolutely have an SBOM for the tool that generates your SBOMs. `cdxgen` itself is a software project with its own set of dependencies (like Node.js libraries).\n\nYou could clone the `cdxgen` source code repository from GitHub. Then, you could run `cdxgen` on its own source code (`cdxgen .` inside the cloned repo) to produce an SBOM for `cdxgen` itself. This 'SBOM for the SBOM tool' would list all the libraries and components that `cdxgen` is built upon."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens if my network is down and I try to upload to Dependency Track?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If your network connection is down and you run a `cdxgen` command that includes the flags to upload to a Dependency Track server (like `--server-url`), the operation will fail. `cdxgen` will first generate the SBOM locally as usual.\n\nHowever, when it attempts to make the HTTP request to send the SBOM to the specified `--server-url`, the network connection will time out or fail immediately. `cdxgen` will then report a network error to the console and will likely exit with a non-zero error code, indicating that the upload part of the process was unsuccessful."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I use cdxgen if my project is in a parent directory?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to run `cdxgen` on a project that is located in a parent directory relative to your current location, you can simply provide a relative path to it. The standard `..` notation for moving up one directory level works.\n\nFor example, if you are currently in `/home/user/project/src` and you want to scan the entire project located at `/home/user/project`, you would run the command `cdxgen ..`. `cdxgen` will then start its scan from the parent directory."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen to see if I'm using GPL-licensed code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can absolutely use `cdxgen` to help determine if you are using any code with a GPL (General Public License) license. The first step is to generate a complete SBOM for your project by running `cdxgen .`.\n\nOnce you have the `bom.json` file, you can inspect it. Each component entry in the SBOM should have a `licenses` field. You can manually search this file for any GPL license identifiers (like `GPL-2.0-only` or `GPL-3.0-or-later`). For a more automated approach, you can upload the SBOM to a platform like Dependency-Track, which can automatically flag any components with GPL licenses based on policies you configure. Using the `--profile license-compliance` can improve the accuracy of the license detection."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the default behavior of the `validate` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--validate` flag in `cdxgen` controls whether the generated SBOM is checked against the official CycloneDX JSON schema. According to the help text, the default behavior for this flag is `true` (`[default: true]`).\n\nThis means that every time you run `cdxgen`, it will automatically perform this validation step after creating the BOM to ensure the output is compliant and well-formed. This is a good safety measure. To disable it, you would need to use the `--no-validate` flag."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen tell me which components are used for testing only?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can often distinguish between different types of dependencies, including those used only for testing. Modern package managers record the 'scope' of a dependency (e.g., `development`, `test`, `optional`, `required`). `cdxgen` parses this scope information and includes it in the SBOM.\n\nWhen you inspect the generated `bom.json`, you can see the `scope` property for each component. This allows you to identify which dependencies are only for testing. Furthermore, you can use the `--required-only` flag to generate an SBOM that completely excludes these test-scoped dependencies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I see all the examples for using cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `cdxgen` help menu provides a dedicated `Examples` section at the end of its output to show you some common usage patterns. To see these examples, you just need to display the help menu.\n\nRun `cdxgen -h` or `cdxgen --help` in your terminal. Scroll to the bottom of the output, and you will find the `Examples` section, which includes commands for scanning Java, JavaScript, and Python projects, as well as how to run `cdxgen` as a server."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does `--no` prefix on a boolean argument do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--no-` prefix is a convention used by `cdxgen` and many other command-line tools to negate a boolean argument. It's used for flags that are enabled by default.\n\nFor example, the `--recurse` flag is on by default. If you want to turn it off, you can't just omit it; you have to explicitly disable it by using `--no-recurse`. This provides a clear and unambiguous way to toggle a feature from its default `true` state to `false`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify the CycloneDX spec version to be 1.5?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To specify that `cdxgen` should generate an SBOM that conforms to version 1.5 of the CycloneDX specification, you need to use the `--spec-version` option.\n\nThe command would be `cdxgen --spec-version 1.5 .`. This will ensure that the resulting `bom.json` file's structure and fields are all compliant with the CycloneDX v1.5 schema. This is important for compatibility with other tools in your toolchain that may expect this specific version."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `--deep` option do during a C/C++ scan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "During a C/C++ scan, the `--deep` option is particularly important because dependency management in these languages is often not centralized in a single manifest file. A simple scan might miss many dependencies.\n\nThe `--deep` flag tells `cdxgen` to perform a more exhaustive search. This could involve recursively scanning for header files (`.h`, `.hpp`), analyzing Makefiles or CMakeLists.txt in more detail, and even performing binary analysis on any compiled objects or libraries it finds. This results in a much more complete and accurate inventory of the libraries your C/C++ application is using."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen analyze a Ruby project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` is capable of analyzing Ruby projects to create an SBOM. It understands Ruby's dependency management system, which uses Bundler and relies on `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` files.\n\nTo scan a Ruby project, you would run `cdxgen -t ruby .` from the project's root directory. The tool's Ruby analyzer will parse the `Gemfile.lock` to get a precise list of all the gems (libraries) and their versions that your project depends on, and it will include this information in the output SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a way to exclude multiple project types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can exclude multiple project types from a scan. The `--exclude-type` option is an array flag, meaning you can use it repeatedly in the same command to build a list of types to ignore.\n\nFor example, if you are scanning a large mono-repo and want to generate an SBOM for everything except for the Go and Python projects, you would run: `cdxgen --exclude-type go --exclude-type python .`. This provides fine-grained control over the scope of a recursive scan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the default value for the `--json-pretty` flag?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The default value for the `--json-pretty` flag is `false`. This is indicated in the help documentation by `[boolean] [default: false]`.\n\nThis means that by default, `cdxgen` will produce a minified JSON output, with all content on a single line. To get the human-readable, indented JSON format, you must explicitly enable it by adding the `--json-pretty` flag to your command."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I pass the Dependency Track api key in the cdxgen command?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To pass the Dependency Track API key directly in the `cdxgen` command, you use the `--api-key` option. You provide your secret key as the argument to this option.\n\nYour command would look like this: `cdxgen . --server-url <URL> --api-key \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"`. It's important to enclose the key in quotes, especially if it contains special characters. However, for security reasons, it's generally better to use environment variables for sensitive data like API keys in automated scripts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use cdxgen to find out if my project uses OpenSSL?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` can help you determine if your project uses OpenSSL, especially with the right flags. OpenSSL is a cryptographic library, and to ensure it's explicitly included in the SBOM, you should use the `--include-crypto` flag.\n\nAdditionally, for a comprehensive search, especially if OpenSSL is a system-level dependency, using the `--deep` flag is recommended. The command `cdxgen --include-crypto --deep .` would perform a thorough scan. After generating the `bom.json` file, you can search within it for the component named 'openssl' to confirm its presence and check its version."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the `--profile` option?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--profile` option in `cdxgen` allows you to customize the generated SBOM for a specific use case. Different use cases, like security scanning, license compliance, or threat modeling, can benefit from having different kinds of information in the SBOM.\n\nBy selecting a profile (e.g., `--profile appsec` or `--profile license-compliance`), you are telling `cdxgen` to optimize the SBOM's content for that purpose. This might involve collecting extra metadata, including more detailed evidence, or structuring the data in a way that is most useful for tools designed for that specific profile."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I generate an SBOM for a Gradle project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` fully supports analyzing Java or Kotlin projects that are built with Gradle. When you run `cdxgen` on a Java/Kotlin project (`-t java` or `-t kotlin`), it will automatically look for Gradle's build files.\n\nIt will search for `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` files and analyze them to determine your project's dependencies. `cdxgen` can invoke Gradle tasks to get an accurate dependency graph, which it then uses to create the CycloneDX SBOM. For best results, ensure your project's dependencies are well-defined in your Gradle build scripts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I disable the signing of the SBOM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By default, `cdxgen` does not sign the SBOM. The signing feature is opt-in. You only get a signed SBOM if you explicitly add the `--generate-key-and-sign` flag to your command.\n\nTherefore, to disable the signing of the SBOM, you simply need to make sure that the `--generate-key-and-sign` flag is not present in your command. If the flag is not there, `cdxgen` will produce a standard, unsigned SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify that a project has no version in Dependency Track?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to upload a project to Dependency Track and explicitly state that it has no version, you can simply omit the `--project-version` flag from your `cdxgen` command. The help text indicates that the default value for this option is an empty string (`[default: \"\"]`).\n\nWhen `cdxgen` uploads the SBOM, it will send an empty string as the version. Dependency Track will then display the project without a version number. While possible, it's generally a best practice to use meaningful versions for better tracking and auditing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is `[default: true]` notation for a boolean argument?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The notation `[boolean] [default: true]` provides two key pieces of information about a command-line flag. The `[boolean]` part indicates that it's a simple on/off switch that doesn't require a value after it.\n\nThe `[default: true]` part tells you that the feature controlled by this flag is ENABLED by default. `cdxgen` will act as if the flag is present even if you don't type it. To turn the feature OFF, you must explicitly use the `--no-` prefix, for example, `--no-validate` to disable validation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I filter my SBOM by purl?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can filter the components in your SBOM based on their Package URL (purl) using either the `--filter` or `--only` options. The `--filter` option will *exclude* any component whose purl contains the keyword you specify. For example, `cdxgen --filter 'test'` will remove components with 'test' in their purl.\n\nThe `--only` option does the opposite: it *includes* only the components whose purl contains the keyword. For example, `cdxgen --only 'com.mycompany'` is a great way to create an SBOM of just your first-party components, assuming their purls contain your company's identifier."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use `cdxgen` to create a list of all licenses in my project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` is an excellent tool for creating a list of all licenses used in your project. A primary function of an SBOM is to record the license for each software component. After running `cdxgen .` to generate a `bom.json`, this file will contain all the license information.\n\nWhile you can manually parse the JSON file, a better approach is to use a tool that can process the SBOM. Uploading the `bom.json` to a platform like Dependency-Track will give you a clean, browsable, and searchable list of all unique licenses found in your project. For best results, use the `--profile license-compliance` when generating the SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen resolve class names for languages other than Java?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The help documentation for the `-c, --resolve-class` option explicitly states that this feature is for `jars only for now`. A JAR (Java Archive) is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources into one file.\n\nThis indicates that the class name resolution feature is currently implemented specifically for the Java ecosystem. While `cdxgen` may support this for other languages in the future, based on the provided text, it is limited to Java JARs at this time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I get an SBOM for just my direct dependencies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While `cdxgen` doesn't have a specific flag named `--direct-only`, you can achieve a similar outcome by controlling the analysis depth. One way is to prevent the installation of dependencies and ensure you don't have a lock file.\n\nIf you run `cdxgen --no-install-deps .` on a project with a `package.json` but no `package-lock.json`, the analysis will be based on the direct dependencies listed in `package.json`. However, the most robust way to control dependency depth is often done by post-processing the generated SBOM with another tool that can trim the dependency graph to a specific depth."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between `cdxgen completion` and `cdxgen -h`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `cdxgen completion` command and the `cdxgen -h` command serve two very different purposes. The `cdxgen -h` (or `--help`) command is for human users; it prints a descriptive help menu to the console that lists and explains all the available options and commands.\n\nThe `cdxgen completion` command is for your shell (like bash or zsh). It generates a script that, when installed correctly, enables command-line tab completion. This means you can type `cdxgen --` and press the Tab key to have your shell automatically suggest or complete the available options, making the tool faster and easier to use."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify the path to my project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To specify the path to the project you want to scan, you provide it as the last argument to the `cdxgen` command, after all the options. You can use either a relative or an absolute path.\n\nIf your project is in the current directory, you can use `.`, as in `cdxgen .`. If it's in a subdirectory named `my-app`, you would use `cdxgen ./my-app`. If it's in a completely different location, you could provide the full absolute path, like `cdxgen /var/www/my-project`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does `--no-recurse` do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `--no-recurse` flag explicitly disables the default recursive scanning behavior of `cdxgen`. By default, `cdxgen` will search through all subdirectories of the path you provide to find any and all projects to include in the SBOM.\n\nWhen you use `--no-recurse`, you are telling `cdxgen` to only look for project manifest files in the single directory you specified and to ignore anything in its subdirectories. This is useful if you want to generate an SBOM for a single project at the root of a repository while ignoring other nested projects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I use the server mode of cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To use the server mode of `cdxgen`, you start the tool with the `--server` flag. This launches a long-running process that listens for HTTP requests, rather than performing a one-time scan.\n\nThe command is `cdxgen --server`. By default, it will listen on `127.0.0.1:9090`. You can then send API requests to this server (e.g., using `curl`) to generate SBOMs on demand without having to re-initialize the `cdxgen` tool for every scan. You can change the listen address and port with the `--server-host` and `--server-port` flags, respectively."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the default behavior if `--install-deps` is not specified for a container scan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The help text for `--install-deps` provides specific information about its behavior for container scans. It states that the default value is `true` but it is `disabled for containers and oci scans`.\n\nThis means that even though the global default for the flag is `true`, `cdxgen` has special logic to automatically disable it when it detects that the input is a container image. This is a sensible safety measure to prevent the tool from attempting to modify the contents of the container image it is analyzing. Therefore, if you are scanning a container and do not specify `--install-deps`, it will be off."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cdxgen detect dependencies from a `build.gradle` file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` is capable of detecting dependencies from a `build.gradle` file, which is the standard build script for projects using the Gradle build tool, common in the Java and Android ecosystems.\n\nWhen you run `cdxgen` with the appropriate type (e.g., `-t java`), its Java analyzer will identify the `build.gradle` file. It can then invoke Gradle itself to resolve the dependency graph, ensuring a highly accurate and complete list of components for the SBOM. This includes direct and transitive dependencies from repositories like Maven Central."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens if I try to use a profile that doesn't exist?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you try to use a profile that doesn't exist by providing an invalid value to the `--profile` option, `cdxgen` will reject the command and exit with an error. The help text for `--profile` includes a specific list of `[choices: ...]`.\n\nCommand-line argument parsers use this list to validate user input. If you were to run `cdxgen --profile my-custom-profile .`, the parser would see that 'my-custom-profile' is not in the list of valid choices and would immediately report an error, typically suggesting the available valid options. This prevents the tool from running with an invalid configuration."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I make my build fail if a dependency extractor fails?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ensure that your build fails if any part of the dependency analysis process fails, you must use the `--fail-on-error` flag. This flag changes the tool's exit behavior in case of an error.\n\nBy default, `cdxgen` might continue and produce a partial SBOM even if one analyzer fails. But with `cdxgen --fail-on-error .`, any failure during dependency extraction will cause `cdxgen` to immediately terminate with a non-zero exit code. CI/CD systems will interpret this as a build failure, effectively stopping your pipeline and alerting you to the problem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I print the SBOM as a table?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To print the generated SBOM in a nicely formatted, human-readable table directly in your terminal, you should use the `-p` or `--print` flag. This option changes the output from a machine-readable JSON file to a console-friendly table.\n\nThe command `cdxgen -p .` will scan the current directory and then display the results as a table with a tree structure, showing the relationships between your project's dependencies. This is very useful for quick reviews and manual inspection."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use the cdxgen docker image without installing docker on my machine?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, you cannot use the `cdxgen` Docker image without having Docker (or a compatible container runtime like Podman) installed on your machine. Docker images are packages that require a container engine to run.\n\nThe Docker image is a way to avoid installing `cdxgen`'s specific dependencies (like Node.js or Deno), but it has its own dependency: the Docker platform itself. If you cannot install Docker, you would need to choose one of the other installation methods, such as `npm`, `brew`, or `deno`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify a parent project in Dependency-Track?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To specify a parent project for the SBOM you are uploading to Dependency-Track, you use the `--parent-project-id` option. This allows you to create hierarchical relationships between your projects, for example, to model a large application composed of several microservices.\n\nYou need to provide the unique UUID of the existing parent project in Dependency-Track. The command would look like: `cdxgen . --server-url ... --api-key ... --project-name my-microservice --parent-project-id <UUID_of_main_app>`. This will nest 'my-microservice' under the main application project in the Dependency-Track UI."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does cdxgen support Swift or Objective-C projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `cdxgen` is capable of analyzing iOS/macOS projects written in Swift or Objective-C. It supports common dependency managers in the Apple ecosystem, such as CocoaPods and the Swift Package Manager (SPM).\n\nTo scan such a project, you would use the appropriate project type, for example, `cdxgen -t swift .`. `cdxgen` will then look for files like `Package.swift`, `Package.resolved`, or `Podfile.lock` to identify the project's dependencies and generate a complete SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the benefit of a deep search when scanning an OCI image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When scanning an OCI (Open Container Initiative) image, a deep search using the `--deep` flag provides a significantly more comprehensive SBOM than a standard scan. A standard scan might only look at the package manager database (e.g., `apt`, `apk`, `rpm`), which only lists software installed via that manager.\n\nThe `--deep` flag tells `cdxgen` to go further and perform a full filesystem scan of the container image layers. This allows it to discover software that was installed manually, compiled from source, or included as static binaries, which would be completely invisible to a standard package manager query."}]}
