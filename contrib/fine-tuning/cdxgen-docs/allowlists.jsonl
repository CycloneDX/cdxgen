  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What project types are related to Ruby analysis?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the Ruby ecosystem, cdxgen supports several project types to correctly identify and analyze your application. The list of supported types includes `ruby`, `gems`, `rubygems`, `bundler`, `rb`, and `gemspec`.\n\nThese types cover general Ruby projects (`ruby`, `rb`), projects managed with Bundler (`bundler`), and even direct analysis of Gem specifications (`gemspec`). This variety ensures that cdxgen can handle different kinds of Ruby projects and configurations, whether it's a full-fledged Rails application with a `Gemfile` or a simple library with a `.gemspec` file. The primary tool used for this analysis is `bundle`, which must be in your `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My project uses Conan for C++ dependency management. How do I configure cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If your C++ project uses Conan for dependency management, you should configure cdxgen to allow the `conan` command. You can do this by setting the environment variable `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=\"conan\"`. If your project also uses CMake, you might set it to `\"conan,cmake\"`.\n\nThis configuration grants cdxgen permission to execute Conan commands to inspect your `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py` and resolve the dependency graph. C++ dependency analysis often does not require network access during the scan itself, as packages are usually resolved from a local Conan cache, so you typically do not need to set `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are Jenkins plugins supported for SBOM generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, cdxgen can generate an SBOM for Jenkins plugins. The documentation lists `jenkins` as a supported project type. This is useful for understanding the components and libraries bundled within a Jenkins plugin (`.hpi` or `.jpi` file).\n\nWhen analyzing a Jenkins plugin, cdxgen inspects the plugin's manifest and bundled libraries directly. This process is self-contained and does not require the execution of external commands or network access to remote hosts. Therefore, for the `jenkins` project type, you can typically leave both `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` and `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` empty."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between the `container` project type and the `containerfile` project type?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `container` and `containerfile` project types refer to two different stages of container analysis. The `container` type (along with `oci`, `docker`, `podman`) is used to analyze an already built container image. This involves using a container runtime like Docker or Podman to inspect the image's layers and filesystem to find installed software. This type requires allowing commands like `docker` or `podman` and potentially hosts like `docker.io`.\n\nIn contrast, the `containerfile` type (along with `dockerfile`, `docker-compose`) is used for static analysis of the configuration files that define a container, such as a `Dockerfile`. This analysis parses the file to identify components like the base image (`FROM` instruction) but does not build or run the container. As this is a static analysis, it does not require any external commands or remote hosts to be allowlisted."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is there a distinction between default and specific versions for languages like Java and Python?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The distinction between default (`java`, `python`) and specific versions (`java11`, `python39`) allows you to control which runtime cdxgen uses for analysis, which is crucial in environments with multiple installed versions. For example, if you have both Python 3.9 and 3.11 installed, a project's dependencies might resolve differently depending on the version used. Specifying `-t python39` tells cdxgen to prioritize using the `python3.9` executable.\n\nWhile the project type might be more specific, the underlying tools and repositories are usually the same. For any supported Java version, you will still likely need to allow `mvn` or `gradle` and the host `*.maven.org`. Similarly, for any Python 3 version, you will need to allow `pip` or `poetry` and the host `pypi.org`. The version-specific type is primarily a hint for cdxgen to find the correct toolchain on the local system."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What purpose does the `apk` command serve for cdxgen on Linux?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `apk` command is the package manager for Alpine Linux, a lightweight distribution commonly used as a base for container images. When cdxgen scans a Linux system or a container based on Alpine, it uses the `apk` command to get an accurate list of all installed software packages.\n\nBy allowing the `apk` command in `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`, you enable cdxgen to execute queries like `apk info` to retrieve the names, versions, and other metadata of the packages managed by the system's package manager. This is essential for creating a complete and accurate OS-level or container SBOM for any Alpine-based environment."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are `dpkg` and `rpm` commands used for in cdxgen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "`dpkg` and `rpm` are the core package management commands for two major families of Linux distributions. `dpkg` is used by Debian-based distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint. `rpm` (Red Hat Package Manager) is used by Red Hat-based distributions like RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and SUSE.\n\ncdxgen uses these commands to query the system's package database when performing an OS-level or container scan. By executing commands like `dpkg -l` or `rpm -qa`, cdxgen can obtain a definitive list of all installed software packages, their versions, and descriptions. Allowing `dpkg` or `rpm` in `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` is critical for generating a comprehensive SBOM of the software installed on these types of Linux systems."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I am on macOS and use CocoaPods. What command do I need to allow?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you are developing on macOS and your project uses CocoaPods to manage dependencies for Xcode projects (common for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps), you must allow the `pod` command. CocoaPods uses a `Podfile` to define dependencies, and the `pod` command-line tool is used to manage them.\n\nTo enable cdxgen to analyze your project's Pods, you need to set `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` to include `pod`. For example: `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=\"pod\"`. This will grant cdxgen the necessary permission to invoke `pod` commands to accurately read your `Podfile.lock` and determine the exact versions of all dependent libraries (Pods) used in your project."}]}

It is used to install and manage software on Windows systems from the command line, similar to `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu or `brew` on macOS.\n\nWhen performing an operating system-level scan on a Windows machine with cdxgen, you may want to allow the `choco` command in `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`. This enables cdxgen to query Chocolatey for a list of all the packages it manages. Including this information provides a more complete picture of the software installed on the Windows system, which is valuable for a comprehensive system-level SBOM."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of allowing `nuget` on Windows for .NET projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Allowing the `nuget` command on Windows is primarily for supporting older .NET Framework projects or those that still use the `packages.config` file for dependency management. While modern .NET projects use `PackageReference` within the `.csproj` file and are managed by the `dotnet` CLI, `packages.config` relies on the `nuget.exe` executable.\n\ncdxgen may need to invoke `nuget.exe` to perform a `nuget restore` operation to ensure all packages are available for inspection or to parse the dependency information from these older project types. Therefore, if you are scanning a legacy .NET Framework project on a Windows machine, you should include `nuget` in your `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` list alongside `dotnet` to ensure compatibility and accurate analysis."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I correctly pass the environment variables to cdxgen when running it from the command line?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To pass the allowlist environment variables to cdxgen, you should set them in your shell session right before you execute the cdxgen command. The syntax can vary slightly between shells, but for most Unix-like shells (like bash or zsh), you can prefix the main command with the variable assignments.\n\nThe provided example demonstrates this pattern clearly:\n```shell\nCDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS=<hosts>\nCDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=<commands>\nnode bin/cdxgen.js -t <type> -o bom.json .\n```\nHere, `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` are set for the duration of that single command.

In this case, `foo` represents a common command needed for a project on any operating system (e.g., `npm` or `go`), while `ldd` is a command that is specific to Linux.\n\nThe example shows that on a non-Linux system, your allowlist might just be `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=\"foo\"`. However, when you run cdxgen on a Linux machine, you should enhance the allowlist to `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=\"foo,ldd\"`. This ensures that cdxgen can perform a more thorough analysis on Linux by using `ldd` to find dynamic library dependencies, while not causing issues on other operating systems where `ldd` does not exist."}]}

First, you would need to add the package manager's executable name to `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`. For `conda`, this would be `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=\"conda\"`.\n\nSecond, you need to identify the remote hosts (registries or channels) that the package manager contacts to download packages. For `conda`, this would often be `repo.anaconda.com` and potentially other channels from `conda-forge`. You would add these to `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, for example: `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS=\"repo.anaconda.com\"`. While direct support might be limited, allowlisting the command and hosts is the first step to enabling analysis for unsupported tools. You may need to experiment to see if cdxgen can successfully interpret the tool's output."}]}

The examples and tables list explicit command names like `npm`, `mvn`, and `go`. Using wildcards for commands could introduce significant security risks, as it might unintentionally allow the execution of malicious or unintended executables.\n\nIn contrast, the documentation does show a specific example of using a wildcard for the `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable (`*.maven.org`). This suggests that wildcards are intentionally supported for hosts but not for commands. For security best practices, you should always explicitly list each individual command you intend to allow."}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is `localhost` often included in the `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` examples?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Including `localhost` in the `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable is a good practice to ensure that cdxgen can communicate with local services that might be part of your development or build environment. Some package managers or build tools might run a local server or proxy as part of their operation, and they would be accessed via the `localhost` hostname (or its IP address `127.0.0.1`).\n\nFor example, a development server or a local package cache service might be running on your machine. By allowlisting `localhost`, you prevent cdxgen from blocking these legitimate local network connections.

It controls the software compilation process by creating native build files (like Makefiles or Visual Studio projects) from a set of configuration files (`CMakeLists.txt`).\n\nBy invoking `cmake`, cdxgen can potentially gain insights into how different parts of the project are linked together, which libraries are included, and what build configurations are used. While a package manager like `Conan` provides a direct dependency list, `cmake` can help uncover dependencies that are linked or configured through the build system itself, leading to a more complete SBOM."}]}

  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the allowlisting of commands and hosts important for security?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Allowlisting commands and hosts is a critical security practice known as 'default deny'. By default, cdxgen is not allowed to execute any external programs or connect to any network hosts. It can only perform these actions if you explicitly grant permission by adding the command or host to the respective allowlist. This significantly reduces the tool's attack surface.\n\nThis security model prevents a scenario where a malicious or compromised project file (like a `package.json` with a malicious `install` script) could trick cdxgen into running arbitrary code or exfiltrating data to an attacker's server. By forcing the user to consciously approve every external interaction, the allowlisting feature ensures that cdxgen operates within a trusted, user-defined boundary, making it safer to run in automated CI/CD pipelines and other sensitive environments."}]}

If you were to specify a full path like `/usr/bin/npm`, your configuration would not work on a system where `npm` is installed in a different location (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/npm`). For security and portability, it is best to ensure the required tools are in your system's `PATH` and to only list the command names in the allowlist."}]}

This is the primary security control offered by the tool. You should create the most restrictive and specific allowlists possible for your project.\n\nDefine `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` with only the essential package managers or build tools your project needs (e.g., `npm` and `ldd`, but not `pnpm` or `yarn` if you don't use them). Similarly, define `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` with only the specific registries your project uses (e.g., `registry.npmjs.org` and your private registry, but not `pypi.org`). Avoid using broad commands like `bash` or `node`. By strictly limiting what cdxgen is allowed to do, you minimize the potential for it to be exploited by malicious code in the project being scanned, making it much safer for unattended execution in a pipeline."}]}

When cdxgen attempts to perform a blocked action, it will fail and print an error message that explicitly states which command it tried to run or which host it tried to connect to.\n\nYou can use these error messages as a guide. For each blocked command or host, you must evaluate if it is a legitimate and expected part of your build process.
