{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I specify the project type when using this tool in CLI mode?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you are operating the tool in Command Line Interface (CLI) mode, you can specify the project type using either the `-t` flag or the longer `--type` flag. For example, to scan a Node.js project, you would use a command like `cdxgen -t npm` or `cdxgen --type npm`.\n\nThis flag is crucial for guiding the tool on how to analyze your project and which package manager or build system conventions to look for. The documentation provides a comprehensive table of supported project types and their aliases, such as `java`, `python`, `go`, and many others, which you can pass as an argument to this flag."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What parameter is used for the project type in Server mode?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Server mode, the project type is specified using the `projectType` parameter in your request. Unlike the CLI mode which uses flags like `-t` or `--type`, the server API expects this parameter to be included in the request payload or query string, depending on the specific API endpoint's design.\n\nFor instance, when making an API call to the server to scan a project, you would include `projectType=java` or `projectType=python` as part of your request. It's important to use one of the supported project type values listed in the documentation to ensure the server processes your project correctly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are there aliases for project types? Can I use `js` instead of `nodejs`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the tool supports multiple aliases for many project types to provide flexibility and convenience. This means that several different strings will trigger the same analysis logic and produce the same output. You can absolutely use `js` as a project type for a Node.js project.\n\nFor Node.js specifically, the supported aliases include `npm`, `pnpm`, `nodejs`, `js`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `ts`, `tsx`, `yarn`, and `rush`. Using any of these values for the `--type` flag or `projectType` parameter will correctly initiate a scan for a Node.js application, looking for files like `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, and others associated with the JavaScript ecosystem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What package formats are supported for Node.js projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For Node.js projects, a wide range of common package and lock file formats are supported to cover the diverse ecosystem. The tool can analyze `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and `yarn.lock`. These files are preferred as they contain a complete and deterministic list of all dependencies, including transitive ones.\n\nIn addition to these lock files, the tool also supports project definition files like `rush.js` for monorepos managed with Rush, and `bower.json` for projects using the older Bower package manager. It can also perform a best-effort analysis on minified JavaScript files (`.min.js`), although this specific format does not support evidence collection for the components found."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is transitive dependency resolution supported for Node.js projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, full transitive dependency resolution is supported for Node.js projects. This is a key feature for ensuring a complete and accurate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). The tool achieves this by parsing lock files like `package-lock.json` (for npm), `yarn.lock` (for Yarn), or `pnpm-lock.yaml` (for pnpm).\n\nThese lock files are specifically designed to contain a flattened list of every single package required to run the project, including the dependencies of your direct dependencies, and so on down the chain. By analyzing these files, the tool can accurately reconstruct the entire dependency graph, which is crucial for comprehensive vulnerability scanning and license compliance checks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I scan a project that uses a specific version of Node.js, like Node 16?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can specify a particular version of Node.js for your project scan. The tool provides version-specific project types for this purpose. For instance, to indicate that your project uses Node.js version 16, you would set the project type to `node16` or its alias `nodejs16`.\n\nThis is useful in environments where multiple Node.js versions are used or when you need to ensure the dependency resolution strategy aligns with a specific runtime. The supported version-specific types range from `node8` up to `node23`, covering a broad spectrum of releases. The underlying package formats and analysis capabilities, including transitive dependency support, remain the same as the generic `nodejs` type."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the supported project types for a typical Java project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For Java and other JVM-based languages, there is a broad set of supported project types and aliases. You can use the generic `java` type, or more specific ones related to the language or build tool you are using. The list of aliases includes `groovy`, `kotlin`, `scala`, `jvm`, `gradle`, `mvn`, `maven`, `sbt`, `quarkus`, and `mill`.\n\nUsing any of these types will trigger an analysis suitable for JVM projects. The tool will look for standard build files like `pom.xml` for Maven, `build.gradle` or `.kts` for Gradle, `build.mill` for Mill, or `sbt` files for Scala projects. This flexibility allows you to be as general or as specific as you like when defining your project type."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do I need to have installed to scan a Java project using Maven's pom.xml?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To accurately parse a `pom.xml` file and resolve all its dependencies, you must have Apache Maven version 3.x or higher installed and available in your system's PATH. The tool shells out to the `mvn` command to execute goals that help in determining the full dependency tree, including transitive dependencies and properties defined in parent POMs.\n\nIf Maven is not installed or the tool encounters errors while running it, it may fall back to a manual parsing of the `pom.xml` file. However, this fallback method is less reliable and may not be able to resolve all transitive dependencies or complex versioning schemes. For the most accurate and complete results, ensuring Maven is correctly installed is a critical prerequisite. Using the official container image is a recommended way to avoid this setup, as it comes with Maven pre-installed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does the tool support transitive dependencies for Java projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, transitive dependency resolution is fully supported for Java projects. This is essential for creating an accurate SBOM, as modern Java applications often have a deep and complex tree of indirect dependencies. The tool achieves this by integrating with the project's native build tool, such as Maven or Gradle.\n\nWhen scanning a Maven project, it uses the `mvn` command to resolve the complete dependency graph from the `pom.xml`. Similarly, for Gradle projects, it utilizes the `gradle` or `gradlew` wrapper to parse `build.gradle` or `.kts` files. This process ensures that dependencies brought in by your direct dependencies are correctly identified and included in the final output. The only exception is if the build tool is unavailable and a manual fallback parsing of the `pom.xml` occurs, which might result in an incomplete dependency list."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I scan a project that requires Java 17?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To scan a project specifically built with Java 17, you can use the `java17` project type. This tells the tool to use a Java 17 environment for its analysis, which can be important for projects that use language features or dependencies specific to that version. The tool supports various version-specific Java types, including `java8`, `java11`, `java17`, `java21`, and more.\n\nHowever, there is a key prerequisite for using these version-specific types: you must have `sdkman` installed and properly configured on your system. The tool uses `sdkman` to switch to the specified Java version before running the analysis. If `sdkman` is not available, you might encounter errors or the scan may default to a different Java version. The recommended approach to avoid manual setup is to use the provided container image, which includes `sdkman` and multiple Java versions pre-installed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I scan an Android application package (APK)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can directly scan Android application packages. The tool supports `apk` and `aab` (Android App Bundle) files. To do this, you should specify the project type as `android`, `apk`, or `aab`.\n\nWhen you point the tool to an `.apk` or `.aab` file with the appropriate project type, it will inspect the contents of the package to identify bundled libraries and components. However, it's important to note from the support table that this type of scan does not support transitive dependency resolution or evidence collection in the same way that a source-code-based scan (like with Gradle) would. It provides a snapshot of the packaged components but may not reveal the entire dependency graph from the original build."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between the `java` and `jar` project types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `java` and `jar` project types represent two different approaches to scanning. The `java` type (and its aliases like `maven` or `gradle`) is designed for source code projects. It works by analyzing build files like `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` using the native build tools (Maven/Gradle) to resolve the full dependency tree, including transitive dependencies. This is the most comprehensive method as it understands the project's entire build-time context.\n\nIn contrast, the `jar` project type is for analyzing a pre-built Java Archive (`.jar`) file directly. This method inspects the contents of the `.jar` file, often by looking at the manifests or bundled classes, to identify components. This approach is useful when you only have the compiled artifact and not the source code. However, it is generally less accurate and does not support transitive dependency resolution, as the information about indirect dependencies is typically lost during the packaging process."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I scan my local Gradle cache?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can scan the local Gradle cache to identify all the `.jar` files your builds have downloaded. To do this, you should use the project type `gradle-cache` or its alias `gradle-index`. This directs the tool to look in the default Gradle cache location.\n\nThe tool will scan the directory path `$HOME/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/` for any `.jar` files. This is useful for getting an inventory of all artifacts that have been used across multiple projects on a build machine. It's important to understand that this method identifies the cached `.jar` files themselves but, like other direct JAR scans, it does not reconstruct the dependency relationships between them or support transitive dependency analysis."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I want to scan my local Maven repository. What project type should I use?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To scan your local Maven repository, you can use the project type `maven-cache`. There are also aliases available, such as `maven-index` and `maven-repo`, which perform the same function. This type of scan is designed to catalog the Java artifacts stored in your local Maven cache.\n\nThe tool will target the default Maven repository location, which is typically `$HOME/.m2/repository/`, and search for all `.jar` files within that directory structure. This can be a powerful way to audit all the third-party libraries that have been downloaded by your Maven builds over time. As with other cache scanning methods, this identifies the artifacts but does not provide information on transitive relationships between them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What file formats does the tool support for Python projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The tool provides robust support for a variety of modern and traditional Python package management formats. For projects using newer standards, it can parse `pyproject.toml` (used by Poetry, PDM, Hatch, and modern Pip) and associated lock files like `poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock`, and `uv.lock`. These lock files are ideal as they provide a complete, deterministic list of all dependencies.\n\nFor older or simpler projects, it supports `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`. It can also analyze pre-built Python distributions, specifically `bdist_wheel` artifacts (`.whl` files) and `.egg-info` directories. This wide range of supported formats ensures that most Python projects, regardless of their dependency management tooling, can be scanned effectively."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the tool handle transitive dependencies for a Python project with a `requirements.txt` file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When scanning a Python project with a `requirements.txt` file, the tool's ability to resolve transitive dependencies depends on a specific feature. By default, the tool performs an automatic `pip install` of the requirements into a temporary virtual environment, followed by a `pip freeze`. This `freeze` command captures not only the packages listed in `requirements.txt` but also all of their sub-dependencies, thus providing a complete list of transitive dependencies.\n\nHowever, if this automatic installation feature is disabled, the tool can only identify the direct dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. In that scenario, full transitive dependency information would not be available. For guaranteed transitive dependency resolution without relying on this feature, it's best to use a lock file like `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock`, or `uv.lock`, as these formats are designed to store the complete dependency tree."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm trying to scan a Python 3.6 project, but I'm having issues with the dependency tree. What could be the problem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While the tool supports scanning projects intended for Python 3.6 (using the `-t python36` project type), there is a crucial distinction regarding the environment in which the tool itself runs. The documentation notes that for the full dependency tree construction to work correctly, the Python version executing the scan must be Python 3.9 or newer.\n\nThis means you can analyze a codebase written for Python 3.6, but the analysis process itself relies on features available in later Python versions. If you are running the tool in an environment with an older Python version (like 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8), it may fail to build the complete dependency graph. To resolve this, you should run the scan from an environment where Python 3.9+ is the active interpreter, or use the provided container image which is set up with the correct prerequisites."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can you scan a Go project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, Go projects are fully supported. You can use either `go` or `golang` as the project type. The tool is designed to work with modern Go modules, which is the standard way of managing dependencies in Go.\n\nThe primary files it analyzes are `go.mod` and `go.sum`. The `go.mod` file defines the project's direct dependencies, while `go.sum` contains the checksums of all direct and indirect dependencies, allowing for a complete and verifiable reconstruction of the dependency tree. The tool can also analyze pre-compiled Go binaries, although evidence collection is not supported for the binary format. For source projects, transitive dependencies are fully supported through the analysis of the module files."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is supported for Rust projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For Rust projects, you can use the project types `rust`, `rust-lang`, or `cargo`. The tool primarily works with the native Rust package manager, Cargo. It can analyze the `Cargo.toml` file, which defines the project's metadata and direct dependencies, and the `Cargo.lock` file.\n\nThe `Cargo.lock` file is the most important for a complete dependency analysis, as it contains a precise list of all crate versions, including all transitive dependencies, that were used to build the project. The documentation notes that evidence collection is only supported for `Cargo.lock`. While the tool can also inspect compiled Rust binaries, it's important to note that transitive dependency resolution is not supported for binary analysis, making the `Cargo.lock` file the preferred input for a comprehensive SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I scan a Ruby project, and what files are used?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To scan a Ruby project, you can use a variety of project type aliases, including `ruby`, `gems`, `rubygems`, `bundler`, `rb`, or `gemspec`. This will initiate a scan tailored for the Ruby ecosystem. The tool relies on standard Ruby dependency management files.\n\nThe two main file formats it supports are `Gemfile.lock` and `gemspec`. For the most accurate and complete results, the `Gemfile.lock` file is highly recommended. This file is generated by Bundler and contains a snapshot of all the gems in your application, including the exact versions of all direct and transitive dependencies. Scanning a `gemspec` file is also supported, but `Gemfile.lock` is the only format for which evidence collection and full transitive dependency resolution are explicitly supported."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My .NET project scan is missing indirect dependencies. Why is that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If your .NET project scan is missing indirect (transitive) dependencies, it is almost certainly because a `project.assets.json` file was not found during the scan. While the tool can parse project files like `.csproj` and `packages.config`, these files often only list direct dependencies. The complete dependency graph, including all transitive packages, is resolved by the .NET build process and stored in the `project.assets.json` file.\n\nTo generate this crucial file, you need to run a restore operation on your project or solution before scanning. You can do this by executing `dotnet restore` or `nuget restore`. This command will download all necessary packages and create the `project.assets.json` file in the `obj` directory. Once this file is present, a subsequent scan by the tool will be able to identify and include all indirect dependencies, giving you a complete SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the supported project types and files for a .NET application?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The tool offers broad support for the .NET ecosystem, including C#, VB.NET, and F#. You can use project types such as `csharp`, `netcore`, `dotnet`, `vb`, or `dotnet-framework`. These types cover both the modern .NET (Core) and the traditional .NET Framework.\n\nThe tool can parse a wide array of file formats, including solution files (`.sln`, `.slnx`), various project files (`.csproj`, `.vbproj`, `.fsproj`, etc.), and older dependency formats like `packages.config`. For modern projects, it's most effective with `project.assets.json`, `packages.lock.json`, or `paket.lock`. It can also analyze compiled `.nupkg` packages and binaries. For full dependency information, including transitives, generating a `project.assets.json` via `dotnet restore` is highly recommended."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can this tool scan a PHP project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, PHP projects are supported. You should use either `php` or `composer` as the project type when initiating the scan. The analysis is specifically designed to work with Composer, which is the de-facto standard package manager for modern PHP.\n\nThe tool looks for and parses the `composer.lock` file. This file is critical for an accurate scan because it contains the exact versions of all the packages installed for the project, including the entire tree of transitive dependencies. By analyzing `composer.lock`, the tool can generate a complete and precise Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for your PHP application."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I have an Elixir project. Is it supported?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, Elixir projects can be scanned. The supported project types are `elixir`, `hex`, or `mix`. These types are designed to analyze projects built with Mix, the standard build tool for Elixir, and that manage dependencies from the Hex package manager.\n\nThe key file that the tool analyzes is `mix.lock`. This file is generated by Mix and serves a similar purpose to lock files in other ecosystems. It records the exact versions of all dependencies, including transitive ones, ensuring a reproducible build. By parsing `mix.lock`, the tool can accurately identify all components in your project. The documentation confirms that evidence is supported for this file, but it does not support transitive dependency resolution on its own, implying the `mix.lock` file must contain the full tree."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What level of support is there for C++ projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The tool provides support for C++ projects, which can be specified using the `c`, `cpp`, `c++`, or `conan` project types. Given the diverse and often custom nature of C++ build systems, the support varies depending on the technology used. For projects using the Conan package manager, the support is most robust. The tool can parse `conan.lock` and `conanfile.txt` files, with full support for transitive dependencies and evidence collection when using a `conan.lock` file.\n\nFor projects that do not use a standard package manager, the tool offers best-effort support. It can scan `*.cmake` files, `CMakeLists.txt`, and `meson.build` files, but notes that this analysis may be limited, especially if version numbers are not present. It can even attempt to analyze a codebase without any package manager at all. This flexibility acknowledges the complexity of the C++ ecosystem, providing the most precise results for projects with modern package management like Conan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it recommended to use the container image for scanning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The documentation strongly recommends using the provided container image for scanning because it simplifies the environment setup significantly. Many project types require specific build tools or SDKs to be installed on the host machine for a complete and accurate analysis. For example, Java scans require Maven or Gradle, Python scans may need a specific Python version, and version-specific Java scans depend on `sdkman`.\n\nBy using the container image, you get a pre-configured environment with all of these necessary build tools and SDKs already installed and set up correctly. This eliminates the need for you to manually install and manage these dependencies on your local machine or CI/CD runner. It ensures consistency and reliability in scans, preventing common errors related to missing tools or incorrect versions, and ultimately makes the entire process smoother and more efficient."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I scan a Helm chart?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can scan Helm charts. The tool provides the `helm` and `charts` project types for this purpose. When this project type is selected, the tool will look for and analyze `.yaml` files that define Kubernetes resources within a Helm chart structure.\n\nThis type of scan is focused on identifying container images and other configuration-as-code components defined within the Helm chart's templates. This helps in understanding the software components that will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster when the chart is installed. The tool also supports scanning a local Helm cache (`helm-index` or `helm-repo` type), which looks for chart definitions in `$HOME/.cache/helm/repository/`."}]}

You can use this type, along with its aliases `oci`, `docker`, or `podman`, to analyze a container image from a registry or a local daemon. This is distinct from scanning a `Dockerfile`.\n\nThis scan inspects the layers of the container image to identify installed system packages (e.g., from `apt`, `yum`, `apk`) and application-level dependencies. It's a powerful way to generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for a pre-built container image, providing visibility into its contents without needing access to the original source code or Dockerfile. This is crucial for security scanning and ensuring the software running inside your containers is compliant and free of known vulnerabilities."}]}

It also covers CI/CD pipeline definitions like `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`. The purpose of this scan is to extract information from these definition files, such as base image names, referenced applications, or build steps, to create a bill of materials based on the project's declarative configuration."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there support for Swift projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, Swift projects are supported, specifically those that use the Swift Package Manager (swiftpm). To analyze a Swift project, you should use the `swift` project type. This will instruct the tool to look for the dependency files associated with the Swift Package Manager.\n\nThe tool primarily analyzes the `Package.resolved` file. This file is the lock file for Swift packages, containing the exact versions and commit hashes of all direct and indirect dependencies. This makes it the ideal source for generating a complete and accurate SBOM. The tool can also parse the `Package.swift` manifest file, but the `Package.resolved` file is preferred for its precision. Evidence collection is supported for these files."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does 'Supported Evidence' mean in the table?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 'Supported Evidence' column in the project types table indicates whether the tool can provide verifiable proof or justification for the components it identifies in the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). This is a feature of the CycloneDX SBOM standard, where evidence can include the file from which a component was identified, checksums, or other metadata that allows a consumer of the SBOM to verify its contents.\n\nWhen the column says 'Yes' for a particular file format (like `package-lock.json` or `Cargo.lock`), it means the generated SBOM will contain this rich contextual information. When it says 'No' or '-', it means the tool will identify the component but may not be able to provide the same level of verifiable evidence. This is often the case for scans of compiled binaries or minified files where the original source metadata is lost."}]}

This mode is specifically designed to analyze the YAML files that define your CI/CD workflows.\n\nThe tool will look for workflow files located in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your project. The purpose of this scan is to identify the third-party GitHub Actions being used in your pipelines (e.g., `actions/checkout@v3`). This is important for security and supply chain integrity, as it allows you to audit the external code being executed as part of your build and deployment processes. The scan supports transitive dependencies, which can be relevant if one action calls another."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I get a list of installed software on an operating system?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the tool has the capability to inventory software installed on an operating system. This is done by using the `os` project type or one of its aliases like `osquery`, `windows`, `linux`, `mac`, `macos`, or `darwin`. This feature is particularly powerful for creating a baseline SBOM of a machine or virtual environment.\n\nThe documentation notes that this capability is powered by osquery. This means the tool integrates with osquery's ability to query system tables for information about installed packages (like RPMs, DEBs, or Homebrew packages), running processes, and other system-level information. This provides a comprehensive overview of the software present on a host, which is invaluable for system administration and security auditing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I scan Jenkins plugins?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To scan Jenkins plugins, you should use the `jenkins` project type. This scan mode is specifically designed to analyze Jenkins plugin files, which typically have the `.hpi` file extension.\n\nWhen you point the tool to a directory containing `.hpi` files or a single `.hpi` file with this project type, it will inspect the plugin's metadata and bundled libraries to create a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). This is very useful for Jenkins administrators who need to track the dependencies and potential vulnerabilities within their Jenkins instance's plugins. The table indicates that this project type supports resolving transitive dependencies, providing a complete view of each plugin's software supply chain."}]}

This means that for a standard scan with the `java` or `maven` type, the tool will recognize the Quarkus framework and apply the correct logic to identify dependencies, particularly those managed by the Quarkus platform BOM.\n\nHowever, you can also explicitly specify the project type as `quarkus` by using `-t quarkus`. The documentation notes that this is especially useful when you are running the scan with the `--no-recurse` argument. This argument speeds up the scan by not deeply analyzing the project structure, and explicitly setting the type to `quarkus` ensures the specialized Quarkus analysis logic is still triggered correctly in this performance-optimized mode."}]}

In a multi-module project, you often have a parent `pom.xml` that defines dependencies and properties for several sub-modules. Some of these sub-modules might be libraries, and others might be final, packaged applications like a `.war` or `.ear` file.\n\nThe note cautions that when you scan the entire project from the root, the resulting BOM file could include components from all modules. This might include libraries that are only used for testing or in a helper module that isn't actually included in the final packaged application (the `.war` or `.ear`). This means the SBOM might list more components than are present in the final deployable artifact. It's an important consideration for accurately assessing the attack surface or license compliance of the final product."}]}

A `requirements.txt` file often only lists the direct dependencies of a project, not the transitive ones (the dependencies of those dependencies). To get a complete picture, the tool performs an intelligent two-step process.\n\nFirst, it creates a temporary virtual environment for the project. Second, it runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside that environment, which installs the direct dependencies and all of their sub-dependencies. Finally, it runs `pip freeze`, which outputs a complete list of every package installed in the environment. This frozen list is then used to generate the SBOM, ensuring that all transitive dependencies are included. The note also mentions that this requires a virtual environment to be available to avoid polluting the global Python environment."}]}

The two specific files it looks for are `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock`.\n\nThe `pubspec.yaml` file is where you declare your project's metadata and direct dependencies. However, for a complete and accurate dependency list, the `pubspec.lock` file is more important. This file is created by Pub and contains a snapshot of the exact versions of all your project's dependencies, including the transitive ones. The documentation notes that evidence is only supported for `pubspec.lock`, highlighting it as the preferred source for generating a precise SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is required to scan a Clojure project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To scan a Clojure project, which can be specified with types `clojure`, `edn`, `clj`, or `leiningen`, the tool needs access to the Clojure command-line interface (CLI) or the Leiningen build tool. It uses these native tools to correctly interpret the project's dependencies from its configuration files.\n\nThe tool analyzes `deps.edn` (for CLI/deps.edn projects) and `project.clj` (for Leiningen projects). It shells out to the `clojure` or `lein` commands to resolve the dependency tree. The documentation notes that if these command-line tools are not available or if they produce errors, the tool will fall back to manually parsing the files. However, this fallback method may not be as accurate, especially for complex projects. Therefore, having the appropriate Clojure build tool installed is the key requirement for a successful scan."}]}

The documentation lists a `yaml-manifest` project type that is designed to analyze `openapi*.json` and `openapi*.yaml` files. This suggests the tool has a capability to parse these API definition files.\n\nWhile the primary purpose of the tool is to identify software dependencies, scanning an OpenAPI file could be used to inventory API endpoints, data models, or perhaps referenced external schemas. The table indicates 'n/a' for supported evidence and no checkmark for transitives, which is expected since OpenAPI specifications describe an API's interface rather than a project's third-party code dependencies in the traditional sense."}]}

The `Cargo.lock` file is the superior choice for a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).\n\nScanning a `Cargo.lock` file allows the tool to reconstruct the exact dependency tree, including all transitive dependencies, with precise version information. In contrast, scanning a binary is a best-effort process that inspects the compiled code for clues about its components. The documentation explicitly states that transitive dependency resolution is not supported for binary scans, and evidence collection is only supported for `Cargo.lock` scans. Therefore, to get a complete and accurate SBOM for a Rust project, you should always scan the `Cargo.lock` file if it is available."}]}

The tool's support is centered around pnpm's lock file.\n\nThe tool analyzes the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, which is the key to its effectiveness. This lock file contains a complete and deterministic graph of all project dependencies, including the full tree of transitive dependencies. Because the tool parses this file, it can provide full and accurate transitive dependency resolution for any project managed with pnpm, ensuring a comprehensive SBOM."}]}

The tool understands the structure and conventions of a Rush.js monorepo.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the `rush.js` configuration file and the lock files generated by the package manager configured within Rush (e.g., pnpm's `pnpm-lock.yaml`). By parsing these files, the tool can understand the dependencies of each individual package within the monorepo as well as the overall dependency state. This ensures that even in a complex monorepo setup, you can generate an accurate SBOM. Transitive dependencies are fully supported, as the analysis relies on the underlying lock file."}]}

The `poetry.lock` file is the key to getting a complete list of dependencies.\n\nThis lock file is generated by Poetry and contains a pinned version of every single package your project depends on, both directly and transitively. The tool is specifically designed to parse this file to build the full dependency graph. This method is superior to analyzing just the `pyproject.toml` file, as it provides exact versions and doesn't require the tool to perform a live `pip install` to resolve sub-dependencies, making the scan faster and more reliable."}]}

This is useful for ensuring the dependency analysis is performed in an environment that matches your project's intended runtime. However, this feature has a specific prerequisite.\n\nTo use these versioned Ruby project types, you must have `rbenv` installed and correctly set up on the machine performing the scan. The tool uses `rbenv` to switch to the specified Ruby version before executing the analysis. If `rbenv` is not installed or the required Ruby version is not available through it, the scan may fail. As with other similar requirements, using the official container image is recommended as it comes with `rbenv` and common Ruby versions pre-installed, simplifying the process."}]}

The two methods are fundamentally different and serve different purposes. A `package-lock.json` file is a rich, structured metadata file that explicitly lists every single direct and indirect dependency with precise version numbers.\n\nIn contrast, scanning a `.min.js` file is a best-effort analysis of a compiled and obfuscated asset. The tool might identify libraries by searching for signatures or specific code patterns within the file, but it cannot reliably determine exact versions or reconstruct the original dependency tree. The documentation reflects this by stating that for Node.js projects, evidence is not supported for `.min.js` files, and it is implied that transitive dependency resolution is not possible from this format."}]}

This instructs the tool to look in the default location where Helm caches chart information.\n\nThe specific path it scans is `$HOME/.cache/helm/repository/` for `*.yaml` files. This scan will inventory the charts that you have added to your local Helm client from various repositories. It's a useful way to audit the available charts on a development or build machine. However, this type of scan inventories the chart definitions themselves and does not analyze the contents of the container images referenced within them."}]}

This is useful for creating an inventory of all Java and Scala libraries that have been used on a machine. Like other cache-scanning methods, this identifies the individual artifacts but does not provide the context of which project they belong to or what their transitive relationships are.

Additionally, the `universal` or `containerfile` project type can parse `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`. This demonstrates that the tool is capable of analyzing various pipeline-as-code formats to identify builder images, scripts, and tools used in your software's construction."}]}

This involves reading the `pom.xml` file directly and attempting to extract dependency information from the XML structure. This manual parsing is considered a best-effort approach and is less reliable, as it may struggle with complex features like parent POMs, dependency management sections, and properties, potentially leading to an incomplete list of transitive dependencies."}]}

You can use the `pdm` alias for the project type, or a general `python` type will also correctly identify and handle the project. The tool's support is centered on PDM's lock file.\n\nThe key file for analysis is `pdm.lock`. This file is generated by PDM and contains a complete, deterministic list of all direct and indirect dependencies with their exact versions. By parsing `pdm.lock`, the tool can generate a highly accurate SBOM without needing to install the packages. This method fully supports transitive dependency resolution, making it a reliable way to inventory your PDM-managed project."}]}

The `jar` type analyzes one file at a time, inspecting its contents for metadata. The `sbt-cache` type is a specialized scan that recursively searches the entire `$HOME/.ivy2/cache/` directory for all `.jar` files. In both cases, the analysis is limited to the contents of the `.jar` itself and does not support transitive dependency resolution, as that context is not present in the compiled artifact."}]}

To do this, you would use the `linux` project type, which is an alias for the more general `os` (Operating System) scan type. This feature is designed to create a baseline SBOM of a machine.\n\nThis functionality is powered by an integration with osquery. The tool uses osquery to query the system's native package manager database, such as RPM for Red Hat-based systems or DPKG for Debian-based systems. This allows it to list the installed packages and their versions, providing a comprehensive overview of the software installed on the Linux host."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a way to scan a project without deep recursion for performance reasons?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the documentation mentions a `--no-recurse` argument, which suggests it is possible to run a scan without deep recursion for improved performance. This flag would limit the scan to the top-level directory and prevent it from traversing into subdirectories.\n\nThe documentation brings this up in the context of Quarkus projects. It states that if you use `--no-recurse`, it's especially important to explicitly set the project type with `-t quarkus`. This implies that without recursion, the tool might not automatically discover that it's a Quarkus project, so you need to provide that hint directly. This allows you to gain performance while still ensuring the correct, specialized analysis logic is applied."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the supported project types for TypeScript?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TypeScript projects are scanned using the same project types as Node.js and JavaScript projects. The documentation lists `typescript`, `ts`, and `tsx` as explicit aliases for the Node.js project type. You can also use more general aliases like `nodejs`, `js`, or `npm`.\n\nWhen any of these project types are used, the tool analyzes the project's package manager lock files, such as `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`, to determine dependencies. Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and uses the same npm/Yarn/pnpm ecosystem for package management, the dependency analysis process is identical. The tool will identify all the JavaScript packages your TypeScript project depends on, including the TypeScript compiler and any type definition packages (`@types/...`)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are Kubernetes Operators scannable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, Kubernetes Operators can be scanned. The `operator` project type is listed as an alias within the `universal` / `containerfile` group, which is designed for scanning various configuration and infrastructure-as-code files. This is a logical fit, as Operators are often defined by a collection of YAML manifests.\n\nWhen you use this project type, the tool will parse the YAML files that constitute the Operator, such as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Deployments, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules. The main goal of the scan is to identify the container images referenced in the Operator's Deployment or StatefulSet definitions. This allows you to generate an SBOM for the software components that make up the Operator itself, which is crucial for securing your cluster's control plane."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `hatch` project type for Python?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `hatch` project type is for scanning Python projects that are managed with the Hatch project manager. Hatch is a modern, extensible tool for managing Python projects, including dependencies, environments, and packaging. It is listed as one of the supported aliases for the `python` project type.\n\nWhen scanning a Hatch project, the tool will primarily look for the `pyproject.toml` file, which is the standard configuration file used by Hatch (and other modern Python tools). To get a complete list of dependencies, including transitive ones, the tool would ideally work with a lock file generated by the project's dependency management plugin (as Hatch itself can be configured to use different backends). The support for `hatch` shows that the tool keeps pace with the evolving Python tooling landscape."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does the tool support Bazel builds for Java projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the tool has support for Java projects that are built using Bazel. The documentation includes `bazel` in the list of supported package formats for the default Java project type. This indicates that the tool can interpret Bazel's build definitions to discover dependencies.\n\nWhen scanning a Bazel project, the tool will analyze the `BUILD` or `.bzl` files to understand the project's structure and its external dependencies, which are often managed in a `WORKSPACE` file. Integrating with a complex build system like Bazel is non-trivial, but its inclusion shows a commitment to supporting large-scale enterprise project structures. For the most accurate results, the analysis would need to integrate with Bazel's query capabilities to resolve the full dependency graph."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is `sdkman` required for version-specific Java scans?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `sdkman` (Software Development Kit Manager) tool is required for version-specific Java scans (e.g., `java11`, `java17`) because it provides a standardized, command-line-driven way to manage and switch between multiple installed JDK versions. The scanning tool leverages this capability to ensure the analysis is performed using the correct Java environment.\n\nWhen you specify a type like `-t java17`, the tool internally uses `sdkman` to activate the Java 17 JDK before it proceeds with the scan (for example, before it calls `mvn` or `gradle`). This is crucial because a project's dependencies and build logic might behave differently or fail to compile with the wrong JDK version. By relying on `sdkman`, the tool automates this environment switching, but it also creates a dependency on `sdkman` being installed and configured on the host system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a specific project type for Groovy or Kotlin?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `groovy` and `kotlin` are both listed as supported project types. However, they function as aliases for the main `java` project type. This is because Groovy and Kotlin are both JVM languages that typically use the same build tools and dependency management systems as Java, namely Maven and Gradle.\n\nWhen you specify `-t kotlin` or `-t groovy`, you are essentially telling the tool to perform a standard JVM project scan. It will look for `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` files to find the project's dependencies. The aliases are provided for clarity and convenience, allowing you to describe your project more accurately, but the underlying analysis mechanism for resolving dependencies is the same as it is for a pure Java project."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "For what C++ files is evidence supported?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to the documentation, for C++ projects, evidence is explicitly supported only for `conan.lock` files. This means that when you scan a project using Conan's lock file, the generated SBOM will contain rich, verifiable data about where each component was found, which is a key feature for high-fidelity SBOMs.\n\nFor other C++-related files, such as `conanfile.txt`, `CMakeLists.txt`, or `*.cmake` files, the tool will still attempt to identify dependencies on a best-effort basis. However, the resulting SBOM may not contain the same level of verifiable 'evidence'. This distinction highlights the value of using lock files like `conan.lock`, as they provide the most precise and auditable source of dependency information for the tool to consume."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `yaml-manifest` project type cover?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `yaml-manifest` project type is a versatile category designed to scan various YAML-based configuration files, particularly those related to cloud-native technologies and APIs. It is shown to cover two main types of files.\n\nFirst, it is used for scanning Kubernetes and other container orchestration manifests, serving as an alias for types like `kubernetes`, `openshift`, etc. In this context, it would parse `.yaml` files to find container image definitions. Second, it is explicitly listed for analyzing Open API specification files, looking for `openapi*.json` or `openapi*.yaml`. This suggests a broader purpose of parsing structured YAML for any relevant component or configuration information, making it a flexible option for declarative infrastructure and API files."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there support for `paket.lock` files in .NET?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `paket.lock` files are fully supported for scanning .NET projects. Paket is an alternative dependency manager for .NET, and the tool recognizes its lock file format. The `paket.lock` file is explicitly mentioned in the documentation for .NET projects.\n\nMore importantly, `paket.lock` is listed as one of the formats for which transitive dependency resolution is supported. Like other lock files, `paket.lock` contains a complete and deterministic list of all direct and indirect dependencies for a project. By parsing this file, the tool can create a comprehensive and accurate SBOM without needing to invoke the `dotnet restore` command, making it an excellent data source for the scan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I get a software inventory of my macOS machine?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can generate a software inventory (SBOM) of a macOS machine. The tool provides several project type aliases for this purpose: `mac`, `macos`, and `darwin`. These are all aliases for the general `os` (Operating System) scan type.\n\nThis feature is powered by an integration with osquery. When you initiate an OS scan on a macOS machine, the tool uses osquery to query the system for installed applications and packages. This can include applications in the `/Applications` folder as well as packages installed via package managers like Homebrew. The result is a comprehensive list of software installed on the Mac, which is useful for asset management and security auditing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `blint` project type an alias for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `blint` project type is an alias for the `binary` project type. Both of these types trigger a scan that is designed to analyze pre-compiled binary executables. This type of scan is useful when you lack access to a project's source code but still need to get some insight into its composition.\n\nThe binary analysis is a best-effort process where the tool inspects the executable file for signatures, strings, and other clues that might identify the libraries or components it was built with. It's a powerful capability for reverse engineering the composition of software, although it is less precise and does not support transitive dependency resolution compared to a source code scan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does the tool support Python `.egg-info` formats?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the tool supports the analysis of `.egg-info` directories for Python projects. This format is included in the list of supported package formats for the `python` project type. The `.egg-info` format is part of the older `setuptools` packaging standard.\n\nAn `.egg-info` directory is created during the installation of a Python package and contains metadata about the package, such as its name, version, and dependencies. By parsing this metadata, the tool can identify the components that have been installed in a Python environment. While more modern formats like `.whl` files and lock files are more common now, support for `.egg-info` ensures compatibility with older Python projects and environments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `openshift` project type?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `openshift` project type is used for scanning configuration files specific to the OpenShift Container Platform. It is an alias within the `universal` / `containerfile` group, which handles various infrastructure-as-code and YAML manifest formats. Using this type helps tailor the scan for OpenShift's conventions.\n\nWhen you specify the `openshift` project type, the tool will parse YAML files, looking for OpenShift-specific resource definitions like `DeploymentConfig`, `BuildConfig`, and `ImageStream`, in addition to standard Kubernetes objects. The primary goal is to identify the container images that are being defined and managed within your OpenShift project, allowing you to generate an SBOM of your deployed applications directly from your GitOps repository."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I get a full dependency list for a Gradle project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To get a full dependency list, including all transitive dependencies, for a Gradle project, you need to ensure the tool can execute the Gradle wrapper or the Gradle command itself. You should use a project type like `gradle`, `java`, or `kotlin` and point the tool to your project's root directory.\n\nA crucial prerequisite is that `gradle` or the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) must be present and executable. The tool invokes Gradle to run tasks that resolve and report the project's entire dependency graph. This is the most reliable method because it uses the project's own build logic to determine the dependencies. If Gradle is not available, the scan will fail or be incomplete. Using the official container image is recommended as it comes with Gradle pre-installed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `sbt-index` project type?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `sbt-index` project type is an alias for `sbt-cache`. It is designed to perform a scan of the local Ivy2 cache directory that is used by sbt, the build tool for Scala. This is not a scan of a single project, but rather an inventory of all downloaded dependency artifacts.\n\nThe tool searches the default cache location at `$HOME/.ivy2/cache/` and identifies all the `.jar` files stored there. This is useful for auditing all the libraries that have been downloaded across all sbt projects on a particular machine. It's important to note that this method provides a flat list of components and does not reconstruct the dependency relationships between them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are F# projects supported?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, F# projects are supported through the general .NET analysis capabilities. The tool can parse `.fsproj` files, which are the project files for F#. You can use any of the standard .NET project types, such as `dotnet`, `netcore`, or `csharp`, to initiate the scan.\n\nAs with other .NET project types like C# and VB.NET, the tool will analyze the `.fsproj` file to identify dependencies. For the most complete and accurate results, especially for capturing transitive dependencies, the scan relies on the presence of a `project.assets.json` file. This file should be generated by running `dotnet restore` on your F# project before scanning."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of scanning a `requirements.txt` file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main limitation of scanning a `requirements.txt` file directly is that it often only contains the top-level, direct dependencies of a project. It does not, by itself, list the transitive dependencies (the dependencies of your dependencies), which can make up the vast majority of packages in a modern application.\n\nTo overcome this, the tool has a feature where it automatically creates a virtual environment, runs `pip install` on the requirements file, and then runs `pip freeze` to capture the full, flattened list of all packages. However, if this feature is disabled or fails, the scan will be incomplete and miss all transitive dependencies. For guaranteed accuracy, using a lock file like `poetry.lock` or `pipfile.lock` is superior, as these files are designed to store the complete dependency tree."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I scan a project that uses both npm and bower?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the tool is capable of scanning a project that uses both npm and Bower for dependency management. When you initiate a scan with a Node.js project type (e.g., `npm`, `nodejs`), the tool searches for a variety of supported package format files within the project directory.\n\nIt will identify and parse both the `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`, etc.) for your npm dependencies and the `bower.json` for your Bower components. The dependencies from both sources will be collected and included in the final Software Bill of Materials. This ensures that even in a project with a mix of modern and legacy package managers, you can get a comprehensive inventory of all your front-end and back-end JavaScript dependencies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "For which Ruby files is evidence collection supported?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For Ruby projects, the documentation specifies that evidence collection is supported only for the `Gemfile.lock` file. This is a key detail for users who require high-fidelity, verifiable Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs).\n\nWhen the tool parses a `Gemfile.lock`, it can embed rich metadata into the CycloneDX SBOM, such as the exact file and context from which each gem was identified. While the tool can also parse `gemspec` files, it cannot provide the same level of auditable evidence from them. This makes the `Gemfile.lock` file the definitive and preferred source for a comprehensive and verifiable scan of a Ruby application."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the `maven-repo` project type do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `maven-repo` project type is an alias for `maven-cache` and `maven-index`. Its purpose is to scan the local Maven repository on a machine to create an inventory of all the downloaded Java artifacts (`.jar` files).\n\nWhen you use this project type, the tool will search the default Maven repository path, which is typically `$HOME/.m2/repository/`. It will recursively scan this directory and identify all the `.jar` files it contains. This is a powerful feature for auditing the entire set of third-party libraries that have been used by any Maven project on that system. As with other cache scans, this provides a flat list of artifacts and does not reconstruct project-specific dependency trees."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `hpi` file format associated with?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `.hpi` file format is associated with Jenkins plugins. The 'hpi' stands for Hudson Plugin, referencing the original name for the Jenkins project. These files are essentially JAR archives with a different extension, containing the plugin's code, dependencies, and metadata.\n\nThe tool has a specific `jenkins` project type designed to analyze these `.hpi` files. When you scan a directory of Jenkins plugins, the tool unpacks them to inspect their contents, identify bundled libraries, and generate a Software Bill of Materials. This is crucial for Jenkins administrators who need to track the software components and potential vulnerabilities within their Jenkins installation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "If I use the `js` project type, will it detect a pnpm project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, if you use the generic `js` project type, it will correctly detect and analyze a project that uses pnpm. The `js` type is a general-purpose alias for Node.js projects, and it is designed to be smart enough to identify the specific package manager being used by looking for its characteristic lock file.\n\nWhen the scan starts, the tool will search the project directory for known lock files. If it finds a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, it will automatically apply the correct parsing logic for pnpm to resolve the dependency tree. This behavior applies to other managers as well; it would use `yarn.lock` for Yarn or `package-lock.json` for npm. Using a generic type like `js` or `nodejs` is often the easiest approach, as you don't have to specify the exact package manager beforehand."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Which project type is best for an Objective-C project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For an Objective-C project, especially for iOS or macOS development, the best project type to use is `objective-c`. This type is listed as an alias for the `cocoa` project type, which is designed for scanning projects that use Cocoapods as their dependency manager.\n\nCocoapods is the most common way to manage third-party libraries in Objective-C and Swift projects. When you use the `objective-c` type, the tool will look for a `Podfile` and, more importantly, a `Podfile.lock`. It will parse the `Podfile.lock` to get a complete and accurate list of all direct and transitive dependencies (Pods) used in your project, which is essential for a thorough SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is `go.sum` used for in a Golang scan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a Golang scan, the `go.sum` file is a critical input that works in conjunction with the `go.mod` file. While `go.mod` defines the direct dependencies and their version constraints, `go.sum` provides a list of cryptographic checksums for the source code of every direct and indirect dependency used in the project.\n\nThe tool uses the `go.sum` file for two main purposes. First, it provides a definitive list of all transitive dependencies, ensuring the dependency graph is complete. Second, it allows for verification of the integrity of the packages. The checksums ensure that the package code used in the build is exactly what the project author intended, protecting against code tampering. This makes the analysis of `go.sum` essential for a secure and accurate SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a project type for Visual Basic (.vbproj) files?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, Visual Basic projects are supported. The tool can parse `.vbproj` files, which are the project files for VB.NET. To initiate a scan, you can use the `vb` project type alias, or more general .NET aliases like `dotnet` or `csharp` would also work.\n\nWhen scanning a VB.NET project, the tool will analyze the `.vbproj` file to discover its dependencies. However, for the most accurate results, particularly for including transitive dependencies, the scan relies on the presence of a `project.assets.json` file. This file is generated by running `dotnet restore` on your project and contains the complete, resolved dependency tree."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are `setup.py` files in Python projects supported?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, `setup.py` files are supported for scanning Python projects. This is a traditional way of defining package metadata and dependencies using `setuptools`. The tool lists `setup.py` as one of the supported package formats for the `python` project type.\n\nWhen the tool analyzes a `setup.py` file, it will attempt to execute it or parse it to determine the dependencies listed in the `install_requires` argument. However, this method can be less precise than using modern lock files or even a `requirements.txt` file, as dependency resolution from `setup.py` can be complex. For full transitive dependency resolution, the tool would combine the `setup.py` analysis with an environment inspection (like `pip freeze`), similar to how it handles `requirements.txt`."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does scanning a `pom.xml` file require an internet connection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, scanning a `pom.xml` file will almost certainly require an internet connection. The tool's primary method for analyzing Maven projects is to invoke the `mvn` command-line tool. The `mvn` process needs to resolve the project's dependency tree, which involves downloading parent POMs, plugin information, and the dependency artifacts themselves from remote repositories like Maven Central.\n\nEven if all dependencies are already present in your local (`.m2`) cache, Maven may still perform checks against the remote repositories. If you run the scan in a completely offline environment, the `mvn` command is very likely to fail, which would prevent the tool from generating a complete dependency list. The tool might fall back to a less reliable manual parse of the `pom.xml`, but for an accurate scan, an internet connection is a practical requirement."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `aab` project type?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `aab` project type is for scanning Android App Bundles (`.aab` files). An AAB is a publishing format for Android apps that includes the app's compiled code and resources, but defers APK generation and signing to the Google Play Store. It allows for optimized delivery of the app to different device configurations.\n\nYou can use the `aab` project type, or its aliases `android` or `apk`, to analyze the contents of an `.aab` file. The tool will inspect the bundle to identify the libraries and components it contains. As with scanning `.apk` files, this method provides an inventory of the packaged software but does not support transitive dependency resolution, as the build-time dependency graph is not included in the final bundle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a project type for `nupkg` files?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the tool can analyze `.nupkg` files, which are NuGet packages for the .NET ecosystem. The `.nupkg` format is listed as a supported package format under the `.NET (#C)` category in the documentation.\n\nTo scan a NuGet package, you would use one of the .NET project types (e.g., `dotnet`, `csharp`) and point the tool to the directory containing the `.nupkg` file. The scan would involve unzipping the package and parsing its `.nuspec` metadata file to identify the package's ID, version, and its declared dependencies. This is useful for auditing a library before you consume it in your project. However, this would only show the direct dependencies listed in the `.nuspec`, not the full transitive tree."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "For a Node.js project, which file provides the most complete information: `package.json` or `package-lock.json`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For a Node.js project, the `package-lock.json` file provides far more complete and accurate information for a dependency scan than the `package.json` file. While the tool implicitly uses `package.json` as a starting point, the lock file is the primary source of truth for the SBOM.\n\nThe `package.json` file typically lists only the direct dependencies of your project, often with flexible version ranges (e.g., `^1.2.3`). In contrast, the `package-lock.json` file is a snapshot of the entire dependency tree at a specific moment in time. It contains the exact, pinned versions of every single package, including all transitive dependencies. By parsing the `package-lock.json`, the tool can reconstruct the complete, deterministic dependency graph, which is essential for a reliable SBOM."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I scan a project that uses CMake without Conan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can scan a C++ project that uses CMake without the Conan package manager. The documentation lists `*.cmake` and `CMakeLists.txt` as supported formats for the C++ project type. This indicates that the tool can perform a scan based on CMake's native configuration files.\n\nHowever, the documentation includes an important caveat. It states that this analysis is done on a 'best effort basis', particularly for projects that do not have explicit version numbers for dependencies within their CMake files. Unlike a `conan.lock` file which provides a deterministic dependency list, parsing `CMakeLists.txt` can be ambiguous. The tool will do its best to identify components from `find_package` calls or similar constructs, but the results may be less complete or accurate than a scan of a project using a dedicated package manager like Conan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the `kustomize` project type for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `kustomize` project type is designed for scanning Kubernetes configurations that are managed with Kustomize. It is an alias within the `universal` / `containerfile` group, which specializes in analyzing infrastructure-as-code and deployment manifests.\n\nWhen you use this project type, the tool will look for `kustomization.yaml` files. It will then parse these files to understand how they patch and combine base Kubernetes manifests. The primary goal of the scan is to identify the final container images that will be deployed after Kustomize renders the configurations. This provides a way to generate an SBOM of your application directly from your declarative Kustomize source files, which is a key practice in GitOps workflows."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a way to scan for dependencies in a `Dockerfile`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can scan a `Dockerfile` to identify dependencies. To do this, you should use the `dockerfile` project type, or one of its aliases like `containerfile` or `universal`. This type of scan analyzes the instructions within the `Dockerfile` itself, which is different from scanning the built container image.\n\nThe tool will parse the `Dockerfile` and extract information from its instructions. For example, it will identify the base image from the `FROM` instruction, and it may also analyze `RUN` commands that install packages (e.g., `RUN apt-get install...`) or `COPY` commands that add application artifacts. This provides a bill of materials based on the definition of the image, offering insights into its composition before it is even built."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are there any specific project types for different Node.js package managers like Yarn?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the tool provides specific project type aliases for different Node.js package managers to make its usage more intuitive. For projects managed with Yarn, you can use the `yarn` project type (`-t yarn`). This will signal to the tool to specifically look for Yarn-related files.\n\nThe primary file it will analyze is `yarn.lock`. This lock file contains the complete and deterministic dependency tree for your project, including all transitive dependencies. While you can use a more generic type like `nodejs` or `js` (which would auto-detect the `yarn.lock` file), using the specific `yarn` type can make your scripts and commands more explicit about the technology stack being scanned."}]}

The key to a successful and complete scan is to ensure that your project's `Pipfile.lock` is present and up-to-date.\n\nThe tool is designed to parse the `Pipfile.lock` file, which is Pipenv's lock file. This file contains a detailed, pinned list of every package required by the project, including all direct and transitive dependencies, along with their checksums. The documentation confirms that using `Pipfile.lock` allows for full transitive dependency resolution without needing to perform a live `pip install`, making it the most reliable and efficient way to generate an accurate SBOM for your Pipenv project."}]}
