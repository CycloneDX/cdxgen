### Questions that scored 0:

1.  **Question:** What is the difference between needs and dependencies in GitHub Actions?
    *   **Explanation:** The answer is incorrect because `dependencies` is not a standard, top-level key in the GitHub Actions workflow schema for defining task-level dependency graphs in the way the answer implies. While `needs` correctly defines job-level dependencies, the description of `dependencies` is vague and does not correspond to a core concept. This creates a false equivalence and is misleading.

2.  **Question:** What is the difference between npm start and npm run start?
    *   **Explanation:** The answer is incorrect. `npm start` is a shorthand command for `npm run start`. For both commands, npm first looks for a script named "start" in the `scripts` section of `package.json`. If it's found, it's executed. The default behavior of running `node server.js` only applies to `npm start` if and only if the "start" script is *not* defined. The answer incorrectly suggests they are fundamentally different commands that target different things by default.

3.  **Question:** How do you use Gradle to configure Java toolchains?
    *   **Explanation:** The answer is incorrect because it states you must use a `java-toolchains` plugin. Java toolchain support is a built-in feature of Gradle's core Java plugins (like `java-library` or `application`) and does not require a separate, external plugin. The configuration is done within the `java` extension block.

4.  **Question:** What is the purpose of the CMake package registry?
    *   **Explanation:** The answer is incorrect because it claims the package registry helps avoid the need for `find_package`. In reality, the package registry is a mechanism that `find_package` *uses* to locate packages. It allows users to inform `find_package` about the locations of installed packages on the system, which supplements its search process rather than replacing it.

### Questions that scored 0:

1.  **Question:** How do you implement configuration file parsing in bash scripts?
    *   **Explanation:** The suggested command `eval $(grep ...)` is a significant security risk and not a recommended practice for parsing configuration files. It can lead to arbitrary code execution if the configuration file contains malicious commands. A safer and more standard method is to use a `while read` loop or the `source` command (for trusted files only).

2.  **Question:** What command shows you failed login attempts?
    *   **Explanation:** The command `journalctl -u systemd-logind` is not the correct or most effective way to view failed login attempts. The standard method is to inspect security logs such as `/var/log/auth.log` (on Debian-based systems) or `/var/log/secure` (on RHEL-based systems), or to use commands like `lastb` or `journalctl` filtered for the SSH service (e.g., `journalctl -u sshd`).

3.  **Question:** How do you manage Windows updates through PowerShell?
    *   **Explanation:** The cmdlets `Get-WindowsUpdate` and `Install-WindowsUpdate` are not native to PowerShell or Windows. They belong to a popular third-party module called `PSWindowsUpdate` which must be installed separately from the PowerShell Gallery. The answer is misleading as it presents this as a built-in capability.

4.  **Question:** How do you create self-extracting archives?
    *   **Explanation:** The suggested commands are incorrect for creating self-extracting archives on Linux. `makecab` is a Windows utility. `cpio` is a file archiver but does not create self-extracting executables on its own. A typical method on Linux involves prepending a shell script stub to a compressed archive.

5.  **Question:** What command would you use to compare the contents of two archives?
    *   **Explanation:** The `diff` command cannot directly compare the contents of archive files like `.tar.gz`. A correct approach would be to first extract the archives into separate directories and then use `diff -r` to recursively compare the contents of those directories, or to list the contents of each archive (`tar -tf`) and diff the resulting file lists.

6.  **Question:** What command would you use to count word frequency in a text file?
    *   **Explanation:** The provided command `grep -o "\\w"` counts the frequency of individual characters, not whole words. A correct command pipeline to count word frequency would be something like `grep -oE '\w+' filename | sort | uniq -c`.

7.  **Question:** How can you set system-wide environment variables for all users?
    *   **Explanation:** The answer suggests adding `export VAR=value` to `/etc/environment`, which is incorrect. The `/etc/environment` file uses a simple `KEY=VALUE` syntax and does not support the `export` command or other shell-specific features.

8.  **Question:** How do you configure system-wide resource limits using ulimit?
    *   **Explanation:** `ulimit` is a shell builtin that sets resource limits for the current shell and its child processes, not system-wide. To set persistent, system-wide limits, one must edit the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file.

9.  **Question:** How do you troubleshoot configuration file errors?
    *   **Explanation:** The `test` command is a shell builtin used for conditional expressions in scripts (e.g., `if test -f "file"`). It is not a general-purpose syntax checker for configuration files. Syntax validation is application-specific, requiring tools like `nginx -t`, `sshd -t`, `jq`, etc.
