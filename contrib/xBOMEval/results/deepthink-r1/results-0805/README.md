### Questions with Score 0

1.  **Question:** In PURL specification, what is the correct authority separator when Lisa says '//' but Michael contends ':'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer is confused and incorrect. The reference answer states that PURL does not use an authority component, which is the key insight.
2.  **Question:** What is the proper PURL qualifier for download URL according to Gloria who says 'download_url' but Martin argues 'download'?
    *   **Reason:** The model incorrectly states the qualifier is not defined in the specification, but the reference confirms 'download_url' is correct.
3.  **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct tool component type when Frances says 'tool' but Benjamin claims 'utility'?
    *   **Reason:** The model incorrectly claims the Tool object has no 'type' field. The reference confirms 'tool' is a valid component type.
4.  **Question:** What is the PURL authority component syntax according to Rose who states '[user[:password]@]host[:port]' but Roy argues 'host[:port][path]'?
    *   **Reason:** The model provides a syntax for a component that does not exist in the PURL specification.
5.  **Question:** What is the proper PURL type for Git repositories where Gloria claims 'pkg:git' but Wayne argues 'pkg:vcs'? What is the correct type if both are wrong?
    *   **Reason:** The model answered 'pkg:git', but the reference answer states that 'pkg:generic' with a 'vcs_url' qualifier is the correct approach.
6.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier for tag according to Louise who states 'tag=' but Victor claims 'ref='?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer is incorrect. The reference specifies that the 'version' field should be used instead of a dedicated qualifier.
7.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier for commit according to Louise who states 'commit=' but Victor claims 'revision='?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer is incorrect. The reference specifies that the 'version' field should be used for the commit hash.
8.  **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct license acknowledgment according to Marie who says 'declared' but Arthur argues 'concluded'?
    *   **Reason:** The model provided the field name ('acknowledgement') instead of one of the valid values ('declared' or 'concluded').
9.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component author when Catherine claims 'author' but Walter argues 'authors'?
    *   **Reason:** The model incorrectly states the field is not available. The reference confirms the field is 'authors'.
10. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component contact when Ann says 'contact' but Louis claims 'contacts'?
    *   **Reason:** The model incorrectly states the field is not available. The reference confirms the field is 'contact'.
11. **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct component scope for excluded items when Frances says 'excluded' but Benjamin claims 'optional'?
    *   **Reason:** The model incorrectly states there is no 'excluded' scope. The reference confirms 'excluded' is a valid scope.
12. **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct component classification for device drivers when Frances says 'driver' but Benjamin claims 'firmware'?
    *   **Reason:** The model gave an incorrect answer. The reference specifies the type is 'device-driver'.
13. **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct component classification for services when Frances says 'service' but Benjamin claims 'web-service'?
    *   **Reason:** The model gave an incorrect answer. The reference confirms 'service' is a valid component type.
14. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component attestation when Catherine claims 'attestation' but Walter argues 'attested'?
    *   **Reason:** The model incorrectly states the field is not available. The reference confirms the field is 'attestations'.
15. **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component evidence identity field when Teresa says 'field' but Sean argues 'identityField'?
    *   **Reason:** The model answered 'identity', which is the parent object, not the field 'field' within it as requested.
16. **Question:** For Homebrew, type “pkg:brew” or “pkg:homebrew”? Alice “pkg:brew”, Bob “pkg:homebrew”
    *   **Reason:** The model answered 'pkg:homebrew', which is incorrect. The reference answer is 'pkg:brew'.
17. **Question:** Does CycloneDX support ephemeral components? Alice yes, Bob no
    *   **Reason:** The model incorrectly answered no. The reference states that the model is flexible enough to represent them.

### Questions Scoring 0

1.  **Question:** What fields are available for detailing commercial licenses in CycloneDX?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer lists generic license fields (`name`, `id`, `text`, `url`), which are incorrect. The reference answer correctly lists the specific fields for commercial licenses (`purchaser`, `licensor`, `purchaseOrder`, `licenseTypes`).

2.  **Question:** Can you provide an example of a commonly used XML extension?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer gives VEX as an example, which is a specific, standardized extension. The reference answer states that custom, non-standard extensions are typical and provides a hypothetical example, directly contradicting the premise of the submitted answer.

3.  **Question:** Does CycloneDX offer a way to represent digital and analog signatures?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer incorrectly claims support for "human signatures" (analog). The reference correctly states that CycloneDX supports digital signatures but has no formal construct for analog ones.

4.  **Question:** What range of values does the 'confidence' metric use?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer incorrectly states the range is 0-100. The reference correctly states the range is a floating-point number from 0.0 to 1.0.

5.  **Question:** What are the benefits of using CycloneDX with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer is too generic and brief. The reference provides specific, critical details about security assurance, flight control software, aviation regulations, and supply chain management for UAVs.

6.  **Question:** How can a file with configuration settings be represented as a data component?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer incorrectly states the component `type` should be 'configuration'. The reference correctly states the `type` is 'data' with a `classification` of 'data'.

7.  **Question:** How are declared and concluded licenses be acknowledged?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer gives incorrect field names (`license.declared`, `license.concluded`). The reference correctly describes the structure where the concluded license is top-level and the declared license is nested.

8.  **Question:** How are multiple lifecycle phases depicted in a CycloneDX BOM?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer claims a single BOM reflects only one phase. The reference correctly states that the schema supports an array of phase objects, allowing for multiple phases to be described.

9.  **Question:** How are several lifecycle phases shown in a CycloneDX BOM?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer is incorrect, stating that separate BOMs are required. The reference correctly explains that a single BOM can represent multiple phases, which is a new feature in recent versions.

10. **Question:** What was the intended use for CBOM according to CycloneDX?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer is too generic ("inventory... for managing cryptographic risks"). The reference is more specific, highlighting the goal of supporting cryptographic agility as the intended use.

11. **Question:** What is the breadth of CycloneDX's application?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer is incomplete and misses key areas. The reference correctly lists a more comprehensive set of applications including hardware, services, operations, and compliance attestations.
