How are several lifecycle phases shown in a CycloneDX BOM? - Wrong. However, a slightly worded question was answered correctly.

```
A single BOM has one lifecycle phase specified in its 'metadata.lifecycle' field. To represent several phases, you generate multiple BOMs for the same componentâ€”one for each phase it passes through (e.g., a Build BOM, then later an Operations BOM). The 'version' and 'timestamp' fields differentiate these BOMs for the same component.
