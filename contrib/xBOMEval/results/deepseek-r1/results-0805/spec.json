    {
      "question": "How do claims adapt general requirements to specific system contexts?",
      "answer": "By mapping broad mandates (e.g., 'encrypt data in transit') to component-level assertions (e.g., 'Service Y uses TLS 1.2')."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the necessary elements required to formulate a claim?",
      "answer": "A 'target' (what the claim is about) and a 'predicate' (the assertion being made), with optional evidence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is a claim assigned a unique reference within CDXA?",
      "answer": "Via the 'bom-ref' field, which can be a UUID or other unique identifier."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the necessary elements required to constitute evidence?",
      "answer": "'propertyName', 'description', 'data', and 'created' timestamp, with an optional 'bom-ref'."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ensures evidence uniqueness within a CDXA document?",
      "answer": "The 'bom-ref' field, which must be unique across all evidence entries in the BOM."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the evidence linked to a specific property definition?",
      "answer": "Through the 'propertyName' field, which aligns with a defined property (e.g., 'license:SPDX')."
    },
    {
      "question": "What details are included in the evidence description field?",
      "answer": "Context about how the evidence was obtained (e.g., 'Manual review by Team X on 2023-01-01')."
    },
    {
      "question": "What constitutes the supporting data for an evidence entry?",
      "answer": "The 'data' field, which can be text (e.g., a license), structured (e.g., JSON), or binary (e.g., a scan report)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the evidence creation date recorded?",
      "answer": "To establish the evidence's validity period, especially for time-sensitive data like vulnerability scans."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the necessary elements required to establish conformance?",
      "answer": "A 'score', 'rationale', and optionally 'mitigationStrategies', linked to specific claims or requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the numerical value in the 'score' field represent?",
      "answer": "The degree of compliance, often as a percentage (0-100) or categorical (e.g., 'Full/Partial/Non-Compliant')."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the nature of information provided in the 'rationale' field?",
      "answer": "An explanation of how the score was derived, including exceptions or contextual factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the intended outcome of defining mitigation strategies?",
      "answer": "To document actionable plans for addressing compliance gaps, improving transparency and accountability."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the conformance section demonstrate fulfillment of requirements?",
      "answer": "By summarizing compliance status (score), justifying it (rationale), and outlining improvements (mitigations)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is evidence used to substantiate the validity of claims?",
      "answer": "By providing concrete data (e.g., scan results) that directly support the claim's predicate (assertion)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the target and predicate create a logical structure for claims?",
      "answer": "The 'target' defines the scope (e.g., a component), while the 'predicate' makes a verifiable assertion about it (e.g., 'has no high-severity vulnerabilities')."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do claims ensure that specific requirements are directly addressed?",
      "answer": "By explicitly linking requirements (e.g., 'must use Apache 2.0') to component-level assertions (e.g., 'Component Z uses Apache 2.0')."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ensures the integrity and traceability of attestations in CDXA?",
      "answer": "Digital signatures, immutable evidence (e.g., hashes), and 'bom-ref' linkages between claims, evidence, and components."
