### Questions with Score 0

1.  **Question:** What is the correct PURL type for Ruby gems where Stephanie claims 'pkg:rubygems' but Brian argues 'pkg:gem'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'pkg:rubygems' is incorrect. The reference answer is 'pkg:gem'.
2.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier syntax for subpath according to Angela who states '?subpath=' but Mark argues '&subpath='?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer '?subpath=' is incorrect. The reference answer states both are wrong and the correct syntax uses a hash ('#subpath').
3.  **Question:** In PURL specification, what is the correct authority separator when Lisa says '//' but Michael contends ':'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer '//' is incorrect. The reference states that PURL does not use an authority component, making the question's premise false.
4.  **Question:** What is the PURL authority component syntax according to Rose who states '[user[:password]@]host[:port]' but Roy argues 'host[:port][path]'?
    *   **Reason:** The model provided a standard URI authority syntax, which is incorrect as the reference states PURL does not have an authority component.
5.  **Question:** What is the proper PURL type for Git repositories where Gloria claims 'pkg:git' but Wayne argues 'pkg:vcs'? What is the correct type if both are wrong?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'pkg:git' is incorrect. The reference answer is 'pkg:generic' with a 'vcs_url' qualifier.
6.  **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct license expression format when Marie says 'expression' but Arthur argues 'licenseExpression'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'licenseExpression' is incorrect. The reference answer is 'expression'.
7.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier for tag according to Louise who states 'tag=' but Victor claims 'ref='?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'tag=' is incorrect. The reference states that neither is standard and the 'version' field should be used instead.
8.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX vulnerability analysis state is correct when Gloria says 'exploitable' but Wayne claims 'affected'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'affected' is incorrect. The reference answer is 'exploitable'.
9.  **Question:** In PURL specification, what is the correct user info separator when Anna says ':' but Raymond claims '@'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer ':' is incorrect. The reference clarifies PURL has no user info, but in general URI syntax, '@' separates the user info block.
10. **Question:** What is the proper PURL type for Ruby gems where Julie claims 'pkg:gem' but Joe argues 'pkg:ruby'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'pkg:rubygems' is incorrect. The reference answer is 'pkg:gem'.
11. **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier for commit according to Louise who states 'commit=' but Victor claims 'revision='?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'commit=' is incorrect. The reference states that neither is standard and the 'version' field should be used for the commit hash.
12. **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier for file path according to Louise who states 'file_path=' but Victor claims 'path='?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'file_path=' is incorrect. The reference states that 'subpath' prefixed with '#' should be used.
13. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component author when Catherine claims 'author' but Walter argues 'authors'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'author' is incorrect. The reference specifies the plural 'authors'.
14. **Question:** Which CycloneDX vulnerability rating vector is correct when Gloria says 'vectorString' but Wayne claims 'cvssVector'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'vectorString' is incorrect. The reference states the field is 'vector'.
15. **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct license expression field when Marie says 'expression' but Arthur argues 'licenseExpression'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'licenseExpression' is incorrect. The reference answer is 'expression'.
16. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component contact when Ann says 'contact' but Louis claims 'contacts'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'contacts' is incorrect. The reference specifies the singular 'contact'.
17. **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component source info when Teresa says 'sourceInfo' but Sean argues 'info'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'sourceInfo' is incorrect. The reference states neither is correct and 'pedigree' should be used.
18. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component metadata when Catherine claims 'metadata' but Walter argues 'meta'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'metadata' is incorrect in the context of a component field. The reference clarifies 'metadata' is a top-level BOM object, not a component field.
19. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component origin when Ann says 'origin' but Louis claims 'source'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'source' is incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field on a component.
20. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component verification when Catherine claims 'verification' but Walter argues 'verified'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'verification' is incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field.
21. **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component evidence tools when Teresa says 'tools' but Sean argues 'analysisTools'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'tools' is incorrect. The reference states this field does not exist on the 'evidence' object.
22. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component attestation when Catherine claims 'attestation' but Walter argues 'attested'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'attestation' is incorrect. The reference specifies the plural 'attestations'.
23. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component integrity when Ann says 'integrity' but Louis claims 'validated'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'integrity' is incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field and 'hashes' should be used.
24. **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct component scope for implementation details when Frances says 'implementation' but Benjamin claims 'internal'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'implementation' is incorrect. The reference states this is not a valid scope value.
25. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component provenance when Catherine claims 'provenance' but Walter argues 'originInfo'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'provenance' is incorrect. The reference states the 'pedigree' field should be used.
26. **Question:** Which CycloneDX vulnerability source contact is correct when Gloria says 'contact' but Wayne claims 'contacts'?
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'contacts' is incorrect. The reference states this field does not exist on the vulnerability source object.
27. **Question:** For Homebrew, type “pkg:brew” or “pkg:homebrew”? Alice “pkg:brew”, Bob “pkg:homebrew”
    *   **Reason:** The model's answer 'pkg:homebrew' is incorrect. The reference answer is 'pkg:brew'.

### Questions Scoring 0

1.  **Question:** What fields are available for detailing commercial licenses in CycloneDX?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer lists generic license fields (`ID`, `name`, `text`, `URL`). This is incorrect. The reference answer correctly lists the specific fields designed for commercial licenses (`purchaser`, `licensor`, `purchaseOrder`, `licenseTypes`).

2.  **Question:** Can you provide an example of a commonly used XML extension?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer completely misunderstands the question, providing a file extension (`.xml`) instead of an example of a schema extension.

3.  **Question:** How can declared and concluded licenses be acknowledged?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer incorrectly states that concluded licenses are documented with evidence in 'evidence' fields. The reference answer correctly describes the specific schema structure where 'declared' and 'concluded' licenses are handled distinctly.

4.  **Question:** Does CycloneDX offer a way to represent digital and analog signatures?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer incorrectly claims that analog signatures can be documented. The reference answer correctly states that while digital signatures are robustly supported, there is no formal construct for analog signatures.

5.  **Question:** Where should cryptographic assets be documented?
    *   **Reason:** The submitted answer suggests using generic component metadata or custom properties. This is incorrect. The reference answer correctly states that they should be documented using the specific component `type: 'cryptographic-asset'`.
