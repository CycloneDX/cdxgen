## Manual Assessment

Due to the small model size, prompts included only 10 or 20 questions at a time. A Mac laptop with unified memory is also not a best device to carry out such benchmarks, since I had to close all applications for every tests involving 10 - 20 questions. The focus for today's benchmark is going to be only the logic category.
