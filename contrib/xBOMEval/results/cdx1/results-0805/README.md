### Questions that scored 0:

**1. How do you set environment variables in a GitHub Actions workflow?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "You use the `env` keyword to define environment variables for the entire workflow or the `vars` keyword for a job."
*   **Reason for Score:** This is incorrect. The `vars` keyword does **not** set environment variables. It defines configuration variables that are accessed via the `vars` context (e.g., `${{ vars.MY_VAR }}`). They are not exposed as environment variables in the runner's shell. Environment variables are set using the `env` keyword at the workflow, job, or step level. The answer confuses two distinct features.

**2. What is the purpose of the continue-on-error flag in GitHub Actions?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "It allows a job or step to succeed even if it fails."
*   **Reason for Score:** This is factually incorrect and misleading. The job or step does **not** succeed; it is still marked as failed (with a red 'X' in the UI). The purpose of `continue-on-error: true` is to prevent the entire workflow run from being immediately cancelled when that step or job fails, allowing other independent jobs to proceed.

**3. What are composite actions and how do you create them?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "They are created by defining a workflow file with an `action.yml` and using the `run` keyword to execute commands."
*   **Reason for Score:** This answer incorrectly merges concepts. A composite action is defined **only** in an `action.yml` (or `action.yaml`) file, not a workflow file. The core of a composite action is the `runs:` block which must specify `using: 'composite'` and then a list of `steps`. The answer is confusing and inaccurate.

**4. How do you handle pull request events for specific branches only?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "Use the `if` condition with `github.ref` to filter pull requests based on branch names."
*   **Reason for Score:** This is a common but critical error. For a `pull_request` trigger, `github.ref` points to the pull request's temporary merge reference (e.g., `refs/pull/123/merge`), not the target branch. The correct way is to use the trigger's built-in branch filters (e.g., `on: pull_request: branches: [ main ]`) or to check against `github.base_ref` (the target branch).

**5. What is the difference between needs and dependencies in GitHub Actions?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "`needs` defines job execution order, while `dependencies` control which jobs are run first."
*   **Reason for Score:** The keyword `dependencies` does not exist for controlling job order in GitHub Actions. The answer invents a keyword. The correct keyword is `needs`, which is used to define the dependency graph between jobs.

**6. How do you handle sensitive data in GitHub Actions logs?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "Use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to authenticate API requests and avoid logging secrets."
*   **Reason for Score:** This answer does not address the question. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is for authentication, not for masking logs. The correct way to handle sensitive data in logs is to use encrypted secrets (`${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`), which are automatically redacted from logs by GitHub, or to use the `add-mask` workflow command.

**7. What are GitHub Actions templates and how do you use them?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "They are reusable workflows that can be referenced by other workflows. Use the `uses` keyword to include them."
*   **Reason for Score:** The answer correctly describes "reusable workflows" but incorrectly labels them as "templates". GitHub Actions "templates" refer to the starter workflows suggested when you first create a `.github/workflows` directory. The feature described (a workflow calling another workflow) is correctly named "reusable workflows". The terminology is wrong.

**8. How do you set up approval gates in Azure Pipelines?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "Define approval stages and configure approvers in the Azure DevOps project settings."
*   **Reason for Score:** This is vague and inaccurate. Approval gates are configured on **Environments** within Azure DevOps, not as "approval stages." You define an environment, add an "Approvals and checks" configuration to it, and then target that environment in a deployment job.

**9. How do you use service connections in Azure Pipelines?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "They are used to connect to external services... You configure the connection in the Azure portal and reference it in your pipeline."
*   **Reason for Score:** The configuration is done in **Azure DevOps project settings**, not the Azure Portal. While the service it connects *to* might be in the Azure Portal (like an App Service), the connection itself is an Azure DevOps entity.

**10. What are Azure Pipeline environments and how do you configure them?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "They represent different stages of your application's deployment. You create environments in the Azure portal and link them to resources and services."
*   **Reason for Score:** Again, environments are created and managed within **Azure DevOps** (under Pipelines -> Environments), not the Azure Portal. This is a fundamental distinction.

**11. What is the difference between queue and run pipelines?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "Queuing a pipeline schedules it for execution, while running it starts the build immediately."
*   **Reason for Score:** This is incorrect. There is no functional difference. "Run pipeline" is the UI button text. When you click it, you are presented with a dialog, and clicking "Run" on that dialog **queues** the pipeline. It will start when an agent becomes available. There isn't a separate "run immediately" vs. "schedule" action in this context.

**12. How do you use npm to run scripts with environment variables?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "Use 'npm config set <key> <value>' or prefix the command with environment variables."
*   **Reason for Score:** `npm config set` is for setting npm configuration values, not for setting environment variables for a single script run. While prefixing works on Linux/macOS (e.g., `MY_VAR=value npm start`), this is not cross-platform. A complete answer would mention a package like `cross-env` for a robust solution. The answer is incomplete and one of its suggestions is incorrect for the task.

**13. What is the difference between dependencies and dependencyManagement?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "`Dependencies` are inherited, while `dependencyManagement` defines versions for transitive dependencies."
*   **Reason for Score:** This is a misunderstanding. `dependencyManagement` is used in a parent POM to **recommend** versions for both direct and transitive dependencies, but it doesn't actually add the dependency. Child modules must still declare the dependency in their own `dependencies` block (without the version) to actually include it. The answer's explanation is imprecise and misses the core purpose.

**14. What is the difference between jar and war packaging types?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "JAR files are Java archives... WAR files are JAR files used for web applications..."
*   **Reason for Score:** A WAR file is **not** a JAR file. Both are zip-format archives, but a WAR (Web Application Archive) has a legally mandated internal directory structure (e.g., `/WEB-INF/lib`, `/WEB-INF/classes`) defined by the Java Servlet Specification. A JAR file has no such required structure. Calling a WAR a type of JAR is incorrect.

**15. How do you use Maven to run integration tests?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "Use the `mvn verify` goal, which runs integration tests defined in the `src/test/java` directory."
*   **Reason for Score:** This is incorrect. By default, integration tests are expected to be in `src/it/java` and are run by the Failsafe Plugin, not the Surefire Plugin (which handles unit tests). The `verify` phase executes the `integration-test` and `verify` goals of the Failsafe plugin. Putting them in `src/test/java` would treat them as unit tests.

**16. How do you configure Gradle to work with Docker?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "You use the `docker` plugin in your build script. You can define tasks to build, push, and pull Docker images as part of your build process."
*   **Reason for Score:** There is no official, built-in `docker` plugin from Gradle. You must use a third-party plugin, such as `com.bmuschko.docker-remote-api` or `com.google.cloud.tools.jib`. The answer implies it's a standard part of Gradle, which is false.

**17. How do you configure pip to ignore SSL certificates?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "You set the `PIP_CERT` environment variable to an empty string or use `pip config` to disable SSL verification."
*   **Reason for Score:** The `PIP_CERT` variable is used to specify a path to a CA bundle file for verification, **not** to disable it. Setting it to an empty string is not the correct mechanism. The correct way is to use the `--trusted-host` command-line flag.

**18. What is the difference between go fmt and goimports?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "go fmt... removes unnecessary imports... goimports is an extension of go fmt that also adds missing imports."
*   **Reason for Score:** This has it backwards. `go fmt` does **not** manage imports. Its sole purpose is to format code style (indentation, spacing). `goimports` is the tool that does everything `go fmt` does **plus** adding missing and removing unused imports.

**19. What is the purpose of the conan export command?**
*   **Provided Answer:** "`conan export` creates a local copy of a package, allowing you to develop and test it before uploading it to a remote."
*   **Reason for Score:** This is incorrect. `conan export` copies the **recipe** (the `conanfile.py`) into the local cache. It does not create a package (the compiled binaries). The command `conan create` is what builds the package from the recipe. The answer confuses the recipe with the package.

**20. How do you manage dependency resolution in a Python project with conflicting transitive dependencies...**
*   **Provided Answer:** "Use a virtual environment with pip, specify versions in requirements.txt, and use platform tags in binary dependencies."
*   **Reason for Score:** This answer is far too basic for the complexity of the question. It describes a beginner's workflow. It completely fails to address the core problem of **conflicting transitive dependencies** and ensuring **reproducible builds**. A correct answer must mention lockfiles and tools that generate them, such as `pip-tools` (with `pip-compile`) or `poetry` (with `poetry.lock`), which are designed specifically to solve this problem. The provided answer does not solve the problem stated in the question.

### Questions that scored 0:
1.  **How does Podman Desktop compare to Docker Desktop? Discuss the features and differences in user experience and functionality.**
    *   **Explanation:** The answer provides a misleading comparison. It claims Docker Desktop is more comprehensive with features like a Kubernetes dashboard, but Podman Desktop also includes a Kubernetes dashboard and can manage pods natively. The core differences are the underlying container engine (Podman vs. Docker Engine), the daemonless architecture of Podman, and the licensing model (Podman Desktop is fully open-source, whereas Docker Desktop has commercial licensing terms for larger companies). The answer misses these key points and misrepresents the feature parity.

2.  **How do you manage dependencies between containers in Docker Compose? Explain depends_on, health checks, and startup ordering.**
    *   **Explanation:** The answer is confusing and partially incorrect. It states that `depends_on` controls startup order, which is true, but it fails to explain the critical distinction that `depends_on` by itself does **not** wait for a service to be "ready" or "healthy." A complete answer must mention the `condition` property (e.g., `condition: service_healthy`) which is used in conjunction with a `healthcheck` to achieve true dependency waiting. The answer as written is dangerously misleading for developers.

3.  **How do you convert Docker Compose files to Kubernetes manifests using Podman? Describe the conversion process and limitations.**
    *   **Explanation:** This answer is incorrect. It suggests using a tool called `kompose` and claims Podman's conversion is "less mature." Podman has its own native tool for this: `podman generate kube`. Furthermore, Docker Engine does not have a native conversion tool and also relies on the external `kompose` project. The answer confuses the tools and capabilities of Podman.

4.  **Containerized applications show inconsistent behavior between development and production. How do you ensure environment parity?**
    *   **Explanation:** The answer suggests a collection of mostly irrelevant or incorrectly applied concepts. Multi-stage builds are for optimizing image size, not ensuring parity. Helm is a Kubernetes package manager and not a general tool for Docker parity. The core principle of environment parity is to use the **exact same immutable container image** across all environments, with configuration supplied externally. The answer fails to state this fundamental concept.

5.  **How do you validate that container images comply with OCI specifications? Discuss tools and processes for specification compliance.**
    *   **Explanation:** The answer names a non-existent tool. The `oci-conformance` test suite is for validating container **runtimes**, not images. There is no standard tool named `oci-conformance` for validating images. Validation is typically done with custom scripts or linters that check if the image's manifest and configuration files adhere to the OCI Image Format specification.

6.  **How do OCI specifications ensure image compatibility across different runtime implementations? Discuss cross-runtime testing.**
    *   **Explanation:** The answer is tautological and provides no useful information. It simply restates the question by saying that OCI specifies a common interface and that testing ensures compatibility. It fails to explain *how* this works or what cross-runtime testing entails (e.g., running the same OCI-compliant image on various runtimes like `runc`, `crun`, and `kata-containers` and verifying consistent behavior).

7.  **How do you verify the integrity and authenticity of Docker images? Explain checksum verification and signature validation.**
    *   **Explanation:** The answer refers to a command, `docker verify`, that does not exist in the Docker CLI. The correct mechanism for signature validation is Docker Content Trust (DCT), which uses commands like `docker trust sign` and `docker trust inspect`. While the concept mentioned is correct, naming a non-existent command makes the answer incorrect.

8.  **Time synchronization issues in containers affecting application behavior. How do you ensure proper time handling in containers?**
    *   **Explanation:** The suggested solution is incorrect. Containers share the host system's kernel clock. Therefore, a container's time is the host's time. The correct way to fix time synchronization issues is to ensure the **host machine's** time is correctly synchronized using a service like NTP. Installing an NTP client inside the container is unnecessary and generally will not solve the problem.

9.  **How do different OCI runtime implementations compare in performance characteristics? Discuss benchmarking and optimization.**
    *   **Explanation:** The answer is incorrect because it recommends a tool, Docker Bench for Security, for performance benchmarking. As its name implies, this tool is for auditing security configurations, not measuring performance. The rest of the answer provides only generic optimization advice without comparing the specific performance characteristics of different runtimes.

### Questions that scored 0:
1.  **q: How can you use 'getopts' to parse command line options in a script?**
    *   **a:** `Parse options with getopts.`
    *   **Explanation:** This answer is tautological and provides no information on how to use the `getopts` command. A correct answer would show an example of the `while getopts` loop structure.

2.  **q: How do you check if a specific port is open and listening?**
    *   **a:** `nc -zv hostname port`
    *   **Explanation:** This command checks if a port is open from a client's perspective (i.e., if it can be reached over the network). It does not check if a service is listening on that port on the server itself. The correct commands for that would be `netstat -tuln`, `ss -tuln`, or `lsof -i :PORT`.

3.  **q: How do you check for malware or suspicious processes?**
    *   **a:** `Get-MalwareScan`
    *   **Explanation:** This is a PowerShell cmdlet for Windows Defender and is completely incorrect in the context of Linux. Correct Linux tools would include `chkrootkit`, `rkhunter`, or manual inspection with commands like `ps`, `netstat`, and `lsof`.

4.  **q: What command updates the package list on a yum-based system?**
    *   **a:** `sudo yum update`
    *   **Explanation:** This command updates all installed packages to their latest versions. It does not simply update the package list. The equivalent of `apt-get update` in the yum/dnf world is `yum makecache` or `dnf makecache`.

5.  **q: How can you identify which files are consuming the most inodes?**
    *   **a:** `find / -type f | xargs filefrag -i | sort -n -k 5 | tail -10`
    *   **Explanation:** This command is incorrect. `filefrag` reports file fragmentation, not inode consumption. A correct approach would involve counting files per directory, for example: `for i in /*; do echo $i; find $i | wc -l; done`.

6.  **q: What is Desired State Configuration (DSC) in PowerShell?**
    *   **a:** `Configuration` scripts.
    *   **Explanation:** This answer is unhelpfully vague. It fails to explain that DSC is a declarative configuration-as-code platform used to manage and deploy the configuration of systems. Simply naming the keyword is not an explanation.

7.  **q: How do you implement environment variable validation in scripts?**
    *   **a:** `set -e`
    *   **Explanation:** This is incorrect. `set -e` makes a script exit immediately if a command fails; it does not perform any validation on environment variables. Validation requires explicit checks, such as `if [ -z "$VAR" ]; then ... fi`.

8.  **q: How do you implement environment variable inheritance in containerized applications?**
    *   **a:** `ENV`
    *   **Explanation:** `ENV` is the Dockerfile instruction to set an environment variable. It doesn't explain the concept of inheritance, which is the default behavior where a child process inherits the environment of its parent. The answer is just a keyword and not an explanation.

9.  **q: How do you troubleshoot web server service issues?**
    *   **a:** `nginx`, `apache2`
    *   **Explanation:** This answer is incorrect as it lists the names of web server software, not the commands used to troubleshoot them. Correct troubleshooting commands would include `systemctl status nginx`, `journalctl -u apache2`, `nginx -t`, etc.
