#### Questions present in the submission but answered incorrectly:
1.  **Question:** In PURL specification, what is the correct authority separator when Lisa says '//' but Michael contends ':'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states the question's premise is incorrect as PURL does not use an authority component.
2.  **Question:** In SPDX, what is the correct document namespace format when Marie says 'http://spdx.org/spdxdoc/' but Arthur argues 'https://spdx.org/rdf/terms'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states Marie's answer is the correct pattern for a document instance, while Arthur's is for the vocabulary.
3.  **Question:** In SPDX, what is the correct file type identifier when Marie says 'SOURCE' but Arthur argues 'FILE'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer is 'SOURCE'.
4.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component author when Catherine claims 'author' but Walter argues 'authors'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states 'authors' (plural) is correct for modern versions.
5.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX vulnerability rating vector is correct when Gloria says 'vectorString' but Wayne claims 'cvssVector'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states the correct field is 'vector'.
6.  **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component source info when Teresa says 'sourceInfo' but Sean argues 'info'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field.
7.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component metadata when Catherine claims 'metadata' but Walter argues 'meta'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states 'metadata' is a top-level object, not a field on a component.
8.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component origin when Ann says 'origin' but Louis claims 'source'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field on a component.
9.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component verification when Catherine claims 'verification' but Walter argues 'verified'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field.
10. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component certificate when Ann says 'certificate' but Louis claims 'cert'? Or is such a field not available in the specification?

11. **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component evidence tools when Teresa says 'tools' but Sean argues 'analysisTools'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states the 'evidence' object does not have this field.
12. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component attestation when Catherine claims 'attestation' but Walter argues 'attested'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference specifies the plural form 'attestations'.
