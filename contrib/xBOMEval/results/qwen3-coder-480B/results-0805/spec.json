{
"question": "How are multiple lifecycle phases depicted in a CycloneDX BOM?",
"answer": "Multiple lifecycle phases are depicted in a CycloneDX BOM using the top-level `lifecycles` array. Each phase the software or component has gone through (or is in) gets its own entry in this array, specifying the `phase` (standard or custom) and potentially a `description`."
},
{
"question": "Why is knowledge of the lifecycle phase important for vulnerability analysis?",
"answer": "Knowledge of the lifecycle phase is important for vulnerability analysis because the risk and appropriate response can vary significantly. A vulnerability in software during the 'Build' phase might be addressed by fixing the build process or updating dependencies before release. The same vulnerability in the 'Operations' phase requires urgent patching or mitigation of running systems. Phase context guides prioritization and remediation strategy."
},
{
"question": "How can CycloneDX lifecycle phases be used to track the evolution of software components?",
"answer": "By generating BOMs at different lifecycle phases and recording those phases in the BOM metadata, organizations can track how components evolve.
