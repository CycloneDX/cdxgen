      "question": "What is Docker and how does it differ from traditional virtual machines? Explain the key benefits of using containerization in development and deployment workflows.",
      "answer": "Docker is a container technology that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Unlike traditional virtual machines (VMs) that run a full operating system for each instance, Docker containers share the host OS kernel, resulting in much smaller images, faster startup times, and better resource efficiency. Containerization provides benefits like faster development cycles, easier testing and deployment, improved security through minimal attack surface, and simplified scalability in cloud-native architectures."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you create a Docker image from a Dockerfile? Describe the process of building, tagging, and pushing an image to a container registry.",
      "answer": "To create a Docker image from a Dockerfile, you use the docker build command. This command executes the instructions in the Dockerfile to compile and package your application. After building, you can tag the image with a name (e.g., docker tag <image_id> my-app:v1) and push it to a container registry like Docker Hub using docker push <repository_url>."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container? Explain how containers are instantiated from images and their lifecycle.",
      "answer": "A Docker image is a read-only template or blueprint for creating containers. A container is an instance of an image that runs as a separate process on the host system. You instantiate a container by running docker run with the image name as its base. The container lifecycle includes creation, running, stopping, and removal, with the image remaining unchanged throughout the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Docker networking work by default? Describe the bridge network and how containers communicate with each other and the host system.",
      "answer": "Docker uses a default bridge network to enable communication between containers and the host. Containers on this network are assigned private IP addresses within the 172.17.0.0/16 range. Containers can communicate with each other and the host by sharing this network namespace, allowing for service discovery and inter-container communication without complex network configurations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Docker volumes and why are they important for data persistence? Compare named volumes, bind mounts, and tmpfs mounts with examples.",
      "answer": "Docker volumes are persistent storage solutions that allow data to persist beyond the container's lifecycle. Named volumes are user-defined volumes with persistent storage, bind mounts map a host directory to a container volume, and tmpfs mounts store data in RAM (temporary). Named volumes are the most reliable for persistent storage, bind mounts allow easy sharing of files, and tmpfs is useful for temporary data that doesn't need to be saved."
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the purpose of common Dockerfile instructions like FROM, RUN, COPY, and CMD. How do you optimize a Dockerfile for smaller image sizes?",
      "answer": "FROM specifies the base image, RUN executes commands in the container, COPY copies files from the host to the container, and CMD provides the default command for the container. To optimize for smaller sizes, use multi-stage builds, cache layers effectively, and minimize the number of RUN commands and installed packages."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are multi-stage builds in Docker and why are they useful? Provide an example of building a Go application with multi-stage Dockerfile.",
      "answer": "Multi-stage builds use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile to build images in stages. This is useful for creating smaller final images by only including necessary components from each stage, reducing the size and attack surface of the production image. For a Go application, you might use a build stage to compile the binary and a run stage to include only the runtime libraries in the final image."

      "question": "How does Podman implement pod functionality similar to Kubernetes pods? Describe how to create and manage multi-container pods with Podman.",
      "answer": "Podman provides pod functionality through the podman run --pod argument. You can create a pod by specifying --pod=<name> or --pod-file=<file.json>. Multi-container pods are managed using podman run commands within the same pod, sharing a network namespace and volume mounts."
    },
    {
      "question": "A container fails to start with \"exec user process caused: exec format error\". What could be the cause and how would you troubleshoot this issue?",
      "answer": "The \"exec format error\" usually indicates that the container is trying to execute a binary file with an incompatible architecture (e.g., running an x86-64 container on an ARM-based system). To troubleshoot, you should first check the container's architecture (using docker inspect) and ensure it matches the host system's architecture. You might also need to recompile or rebuild the application if necessary."
