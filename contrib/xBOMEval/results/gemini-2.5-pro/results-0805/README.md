### Questions with Score 0

1.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier syntax for subpath according to Angela who states '?subpath=' but Mark argues '&subpath='?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states that both options are wrong and the correct syntax uses a hash ('#subpath'), as it is a fragment, not a query parameter. The model's answer incorrectly describes standard query parameter syntax.
2.  **Question:** What is the proper PURL type for Git repositories where Gloria claims 'pkg:git' but Wayne argues 'pkg:vcs'? What is the correct type if both are wrong?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer is 'pkg:generic' with a 'vcs_url' qualifier. The model incorrectly states that 'pkg:git' is the correct type.
3.  **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct component classification when Frances says 'framework' but Benjamin claims 'platform'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states that both 'framework' and 'platform' are correct component types. The model incorrectly claims that 'platform' is not valid.
4.  **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct license acknowledgment according to Marie who says 'declared' but Arthur argues 'concluded'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states that both are correct values for the `acknowledgement` field. The model incorrectly claims that neither is correct.
5.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier for file path according to Louise who states 'file_path=' but Victor claims 'path='?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference specifies that the standard way to denote a file path is with the 'subpath' fragment, separated by a '#'. The model's answer is missing this critical detail.
6.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component contact when Ann says 'contact' but Louis claims 'contacts'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer is 'contact', while the model claims it should be 'contacts'.
7.  **Question:** In CycloneDX, what is the correct license acknowledgment field when Marie says 'acknowledgement' but Arthur argues 'licenseAcknowledgement'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer is 'acknowledgement'. The model incorrectly claims there is no such standard field.
8.  **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component evidence call stack when Teresa says 'callstack' but Sean argues 'callStack'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer is 'callstack' (lowercase), while the model claims it is 'callStack' (camelCase).
9.  **Question:** Can PURL namespace be omitted? Alice yes, Bob no, Carol spec.
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states that whether a namespace is optional depends on the package type (e.g., it is mandatory for npm). The model incorrectly simplifies this to a "yes".
10. **Question:** For Homebrew, type “pkg:brew” or “pkg:homebrew”? Alice “pkg:brew”, Bob “pkg:homebrew”
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer is 'pkg:brew'. The model answered 'homebrew'.
