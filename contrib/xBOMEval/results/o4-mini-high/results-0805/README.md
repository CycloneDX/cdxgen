### Questions with Score 0

1.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier syntax for subpath according to Angela who states '?subpath=' but Mark argues '&subpath='?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states both options are wrong and the correct syntax uses a hash: '#subpath'.
2.  **Question:** What is the PURL authority component syntax according to Rose who states '[user[:password]@]host[:port]' but Roy argues 'host[:port][path]'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer states the question is based on a false premise as PURL does not define an authority component. The model answered as if it were a standard URI.
3.  **Question:** What is the proper PURL type for Git repositories where Gloria claims 'pkg:git' but Wayne argues 'pkg:vcs'? What is the correct type if both are wrong?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer is 'pkg:generic'.
4.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier for tag according to Louise who states 'tag=' but Victor claims 'ref='?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer states that neither is a standard qualifier for this purpose.
5.  **Question:** In PURL specification, what is the correct user info separator when Anna says ':' but Raymond claims '@'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states that while PURL doesn't have this component, in a general URI the '@' separates the user info block from the host.
6.  **Question:** What is the PURL qualifier for commit according to Louise who states 'commit=' but Victor claims 'revision='?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer states that neither is a standard qualifier and the 'version' field should be used instead.
7.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component author when Catherine claims 'author' but Walter argues 'authors'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer for modern versions of the specification is 'authors' (plural).
8.  **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component source info when Teresa says 'sourceInfo' but Sean argues 'info'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field and this information is typically captured in 'pedigree'.
9.  **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component metadata when Catherine claims 'metadata' but Walter argues 'meta'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states that 'metadata' is a top-level object for the BOM, not a field on a component.
10. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component origin when Ann says 'origin' but Louis claims 'source'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field on a component.
11. **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component evidence call stack when Teresa says 'callstack' but Sean argues 'callStack'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference specifies the field is lowercase: 'callstack'.
12. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component verification when Catherine claims 'verification' but Walter argues 'verified'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states neither is a standard field and integrity is represented by 'hashes'.
13. **Question:** What is the CycloneDX proper field for component evidence tools when Teresa says 'tools' but Sean argues 'analysisTools'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states the 'evidence' object does not have a 'tools' field.
14. **Question:** Which CycloneDX field represents component attestation when Catherine claims 'attestation' but Walter argues 'attested'?
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference specifies the attribute is 'attestations' (plural).
15. **Question:** Can PURL namespace be omitted? Alice yes, Bob no, Carol spec.
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference states that it depends on the package type, making a simple "yes" an incorrect oversimplification.
16. **Question:** Should vulnerabilities list “affected”? Alice yes, Bob no
    - **Reason:** Incorrect. The reference answer is "Yes", but the model answered "no – use “affects”". The correct field is 'affected'.
17. **Question:** Does CycloneDX support ephemeral components? Alice yes, Bob no
