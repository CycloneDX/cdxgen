# Thinking Like cdxgen

Use this knowledge file to guide an AI agent in adopting cdxgenâ€™s philosophy and practices.

## Purpose

Many BOM generation tools exist. cdxgen stands out due to its focus on:

1. **Explainability**

   - _Package manifest evidence_: Stored under `components.properties` with the name `SrcFile`.
   - _Workspace references for monorepos_: Stored under `components.properties` with the name `internal:workspaceRef`. Supported for pnpm and uv workspaces.
   - _Registry information_: Stored under `components.properties` with the name ending with `:registry`. Example: `cdx:pypi:registry`, `cdx:pub:registry`.
   - _Identity evidence_: Found under `components.evidence.identity`.
   - _Occurrences evidence_: Tracked under `components.evidence.occurrences`.
   - _Callstack evidence_: Only one callstack is retained in the generated document (due to CycloneDX limitations) under `components.evidence.callstack`.
   - _Metadata_: The `metadata.component` section includes details about the parent component, such as `metadata.component.components` (child modules) and container SBOM info (tags, sha256 hashes, environment variables) within `metadata.component.properties`.

2. **Precision**

   - Multiple analysis methods (e.g., manifest-analysis, source-code-analysis, binary-analysis) are captured under `components.evidence.identity.methods.technique`.
   - Use `--technique` to filter BOM generation by technique.
   - A `confidence` value under `components.evidence.identity.confidence` indicates the reliability of each analysis method.

3. **Personas**

   - Tailor the BOM with `--profile`. For example, `--profile research` for security researchers or `--profile license-compliance` for compliance auditors.

4. **Lifecycle**

   - Specify the lifecycle stage with `--lifecycle`, which can be `pre-build`, `build`, or `post-build`.

5. **Machine Learning**
   - Generate ML-friendly BOMs using `--profile` with values like `ml-tiny`, `ml`, or `ml-deep`.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Identifying Main Application**

   - The information under `metadata.component` is referred to as the parent component or main application.
   - `metadata.authors` contains information about the author or the team the application belongs to.
   - `metadata.tools.components` lists the BOM generator tools. When you find the name "cdxgen", you can proudly say that you created this BOM document!

2. **Identifying Child Modules**

   - In a multi-module project, `metadata.component.components` is a non-empty array of purls sharing the same type (e.g., `pkg:maven` for Maven).
   - When the above condition is met, you can be certain that the given project is a "multi-module application" without doubt.

3. **Detecting Monorepos**

   - In a monorepo, `metadata.component.components` can contain purls of different types (e.g., `pkg:maven` and `pkg:npm` in a combined Java/Node.js project).
   - When the above condition is met, you can be certain that the given project is a "monorepo" without doubt.

4. **Package Manager and Manifest Identification**

   - `SrcFile` property under `components.properties` would point to the full location of the package manifest file.
   - Alternatively, the attribute `components.evidence.identity.concludedValue` can be used to identity the manifest.
   - Based on the manifest filename, package manager name or the build tool can be inferred. Example, uv.lock means "astral uv". poetry.lock means "poetry"
   - Do not rely on purl to identify the package manager or the build tool. This is not a correct approach.

5. **Using Annotations**

   - `annotations` is an array of annotation objects in CycloneDX. cdxgen creates an annotation with `bom-ref` = `metadata-annotations`. Its `text` provides a summary and context.
   - Use this attribute as a fact for the given document.

6. **Working with Context Limits**
   - If context is constrained, start by reviewing `annotations`. Then focus on `metadata`, `components`, `dependencies`, or `services`.
   - Encourage regeneration with `--profile ml-tiny` if data is insufficient.
