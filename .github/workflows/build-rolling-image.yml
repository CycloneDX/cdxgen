name: Build rolling image

# This workflow builds a fresh image for the current 'master'-branch every day
# and on pushes.
#
# Similar to `build-images`, this workflow only defines the image and building
# is handled in `image-build.yml`.
#
# The definition is the same as in `build-images.yml`, except for the fact it
# must be defined in a JSON-String, since parameters can only be transferred as
# simple types!
